* Wise Yet Harmless 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: Be ye therefore wise
  as serpents, and harmless as doves. --- Matthew 10:16
#+END_QUOTE

  So said the Savior to his Apostles as he instructed them prior to their first
  missionary journey.

  Is there any doubt that in the midst of wolves is a dangerous place for sheep
  to be? \ldquo{}Wolves in sheeps\rsquo clothing\rdquo is a common expression, connoting greater
  danger because of the element of deception. Wolves pretending to be sheep can
  lull their victims into false security and almost certain doom.

  Jesus knew his disciples would face derision and persecution, but why did he
  tell them to be \ldquo{}wise as serpents?\rdquo Is not the \ldquo{}wisdom\rdquo of serpents that they
  subtly lie in wait for their prey rather than exposing themselves to danger by
  hunting out in the open? Does not Satan \ldquo{}lie in wait to deceive?\rdquo Surely
  deception is not something the Lord would have his servants practice! The
  point is, while Satan has a serpent\rsquo{}s wisdom, or \ldquo{}cunning,\rdquo he uses it to harm
  and destroy. But the Lord wants his disciples to be \ldquo{}harmless as doves.\rdquo{} Is
  there any creature more harmless, more innocent than a dove? Wise, yet
  harmless. There is, I believe, a dynamic tension here.

  Being wise, we know what\rsquo{}s going on in the world around us, and are aware of
  \ldquo{}men and things.\rdquo Being wise as serpents, we know a serpent when we see one,
  and can thus steer clear of it. We know Satan as he is, and we know what his
  tactics are. Besides, how can we say \ldquo{}get thee behind me Satan\rdquo unless we can
  recognize him in front of us? (Or more likely, beside us, whispering his lies
  in our ear?)

  A fascinating case study of being \ldquo{}wise yet harmless\rdquo is found in the Book of
  Mormon. Recall the episode where Ammon and his brethren went to preach the
  gospel to the Lamanites. Ammon had miraculously defended the flocks of King
  Lamoni, whose servant he had become. At first, the king is speechless with
  amazement at Ammon\rsquo{}s power, but when Ammon perceives and tells him his
  thoughts, the king is too amazed not to speak:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  And the king said: how knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest
  speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things: and also tell me by what
  power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my
  flocks --- And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things...whatsoever
  thou desirest of me I will grant unto thee.

  Now, Ammon being *wise, yet harmless*, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken
  unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this is the
  thing that I desire of thee.

  And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words. And
  thus he was *caught with guile*. --- Alma 18:20-23 (Emphasis added.)
#+END_QUOTE

  Lamoni was tricked?! Yes, Ammon \ldquo{}beguiled\rdquo{} him into saying he would believe
  everything he told him! And yet this \ldquo{}guile\rdquo led to a \ldquo{}wonderful conversion\rdquo
  of the king and many of his people. Therein lies the key. Ammon was not only
  harmLESS, he was helpFUL. He was benevolent, seeking to bless; not malevolent,
  seeking to harm. He was not passive, doing nothing so as not to risk doing
  something harmful; he was \ldquo{}anxiously engaged in a good cause\rdquo seeking to
  \ldquo{}bring to pass much righteousness\rdquo. (See Doctrine and Covenants 58:27)

  So we, being wise yet harmless, will use our knowledge and wisdom, not to take
  advantage of others, but to do good and to help others. As the Lord told the
  Prophet Joseph Smith and his missionary companions:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Therefore, be ye as wise as serpents and yet without sin... --- Doctrine and
  Covenants 111:11
#+END_QUOTE

  Sin includes being idly harmless, which is actually harmful, since the good
  that we could be doing is not getting done, to someone\rsquo{}s detriment.
