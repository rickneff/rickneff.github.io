  Help Abu and Ila out. This version of =mod-expt= gets a /little/ better
  mileage than their simplistic one. It keeps the numbers smaller by reducing
  each partial exponentiation by modding it once every iteration instead of once,
  period. What fact or facts of modular arithmetic justify this?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun a-better-mod-expt (base power modulus)
    (loop with result = 1
          for n from 1 to power
          do (setq result (mod (* result base) modulus))
          finally return result))
#+END_SRC
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Reread the interchange between Til, Abu and Ila in PQS.

  Experiment with RSA using the following code. You will need a better modular
  exponentiation function than =mod-expt= or perhaps even =a-better-mod-expt=.
  Implement the =pow-mod= function to be this better version. Note the
  difference between /encoding/ and /encryption/, and between /decryption/ and
  /decoding/.

  How \ldquo{}big\rdquo a message can you successfully round-trip?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun rsa-encrypt (message n e &optional encoder)
    (let* ((message-encoded (funcall (or encoder 'identity) message))
           (encrypted (pow-mod message-encoded e n)))
      encrypted))

  (defun rsa-decrypt (encrypted n d &optional decoder)
    (let* ((decrypted (pow-mod encrypted d n))
           (message-decoded (funcall (or decoder 'identity) decrypted)))
      message-decoded))

  (defun round-trip (message n e d &optional encoder decoder)
    (equal message
           (rsa-decrypt (rsa-encrypt message n e encoder)
                        n d decoder)))

  You will need working =from-base-27= and =to-base-27= functions, as well as a
  working knowledge of /symbol property lists/ to play with /this/ test code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun test-rsa (message-with-spaces)
    (let* ((message (mapconcat 'identity
                               (split-string message-with-spaces " ") "@"))
            (n (get 'rsa-players :n))
            (e (get 'rsa-players :e))
            (d (get 'rsa-players :d))
            (encrypted (rsa-encrypt message n e 'from-base-27))
            (decrypted (rsa-decrypt encrypted n d 'to-base-27))
            (decrypted-message-with-spaces
             (mapconcat 'identity (split-string decrypted "@") " "))
            (success (string= message-with-spaces
                              decrypted-message-with-spaces)))
       (princ (format (concat "\"%s\"\nwas encoded and encrypted as\n%s\n"
                              "then decrypted and decoded as\n\"%s\"\n")
                      message-with-spaces
                      encrypted
                      decrypted-message-with-spaces))
       (princ (if success "" "un"))
       (princ "successfully.\n")
       success))
