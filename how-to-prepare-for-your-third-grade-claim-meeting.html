<p>
As in your first and second grade claims, the most important advice I can give
you is to pray to know what grade you should claim for this third and final
grade claim. I realize that given the unusual circumstances we find ourselves
in, there are many more prayers being offered right now that are much more
fervent than ones about grades. That being said &hellip;
</p>

<p>
To refresh your memory, please reread the syllabus where it talks about grading.
Then
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Triple check that your Course Tracker table is complete, with the grade you
will claim decided beforehand. If you have not yet merged my Pull Request
into your git repository, please do so first and foremost! I plan to use
<a href="syllabus-portfolio.txt#MissingReference">Course Tracker Table</a> as the link to take me to your commpleted table.</li>
<li>As our meeting will be via Zoom, you will not need to bring anything to it.
You do not need to print a Readiness Certification just to show it to me by
holding it up to your camera. Many of you don&rsquo;t have a camera, or at least,
you choose not to use it during our Zoom class meetings. (Which is
perfectly fine &#x2014; and saves network bandwidth too.) <b>But see number 4</b>.</li>
<li>Even though you will not need to bring anything, you must still come
prepared with all the evidences you will present to justify your claim
clearly identified and, <b>most importantly</b>, pushed up to your repo so that I
can look at them on my computer <b>before we have our meeting</b>.</li>
<li>There is a .txt version of this document <a href="https://rickneff.github.io/how-to-prepare-for-your-third-grade-claim-meeting.txt">available at this link</a>. Please
download it, fill out the questionnaire at the bottom of it, and make this
file (the .txt, not the .html version) part of your repo. (And don&rsquo;t forget
to add, commit and push!)</li>
<li>It is still critical to be right on time! Please use a reliable clock and
reminder mechanism to ensure punctuality.</li>

I thoroughly enjoyed this class and to be honest I am a little sad that it is
ending. Before this class I had never seen programming in the light that it
should be seen in. It should be able to be applied to any situation in order
to make work more efficient. Now I will admit sometimes I would spend three
hours writing code for a problem that would have only taken me an hour or so
to do by hand, but the important part is that I can say without a doubt for
every one of those problems not only do I understand the problem but all the
mechanics that make up that problem. I have an understanding that I can break
down the problem into its individual pieces and write functions to represent
those pieces.
</p>

<p>
The second thing I learned from this class is the relationship between
discrete math and programming. There are so many applications. From learning
how to write things logically, to graph theory, and number theory. They are
all just another perspective that if understood will help us understand what
we are working with. Unfortunately if there is anything to say about discrete
math is that I realize that I am just barely touching the surface. There is so
much depth and while I won&rsquo;t be taking the other Discrete Math classes due to
my credit limits I am glad I will be able to continue learning more about it
throughout college and throughout the coming years as a developer.
</p>

<p>
The last and most important thing I learned, and probably the most valuable is
that anything can be learned if you want to learn it. This semester I learned
(and fell in love with) lisp, spacemacs, and discrete math. I learned all
three simultaneously. Why? Because I wanted to! Discrete Math was the class I
most enjoyed working on, and it was like I was missing something while working
with other programming languages and in other classes. I spent my free time
reading ANSI Common Lisp, and applying my skills to the homework and side
projects. I hope to continue to learn both and find future application for
them that will allow me to program not just great code but beautiful code.
There is something so special about writing something that not only works but
does things in a way that just feels right. I have always tried to find this
medium in all my other courses, but with lisp and this application I finally
found a place where the two maxims could coexist. I hope to hold my work as a
representation of my first steps into building and creating beautiful,
efficient, and effective code. There is so much more to learn, but this class
has given me the confidence that I have the ability to do so.
</p>

<h4 id="orgaff499e">From another former student</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaff499e">
<p>
(Where X != elisp, but was new to this student.)
</p>

<p>
Cat&rsquo;s out of the bag! I wrote my program in X!
</p>

<p>
I felt that if I learned lisp I would not be able to learn discrete
mathematics this semester. I personally believe I would fail. Lisp is
different enough from the way I think that I would need to study it for at
least a semester before attempting to use it to practice discrete math
concepts. All my time for this class would be spent desperately trying to
learn lisp and I think I would fail to learn both.
</p>

<p>
In class you said that we should not do hard things, but to do things that
are just beyond our abilities. Lisp is too far from me. However, X is within
my power to learn. It is a new language &#x2014; a new language I can learn in a
couple of weeks while also learning discrete math.
</p>

<p>
I am determined to succeed in learning the essence of discrete math. My goal
in this class is to learn discrete math, not lisp. I recognise that you may
reduce my grade for not using lisp, but I am committed to learning discrete
math at any cost.
</p>

<p>
I am going to succeed where I failed before.

<h4 id="orgd012e7c">From yet another former student</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd012e7c">
<p>
I really don&rsquo;t have five hours to try to figure this out right now. I have
struggled a lot to try to understand the lisp language. I find examples
online which I often can&rsquo;t get to work, if they even give enough information
close to what I am trying to do. What would help is to see some actual code
that does some of what we are trying to do, then I would get it. The mini
primer goes into it a bit, and I have found a lot of good information in
there, but I am struggling with it.
</p>

<p>
That makes no sense. I don&rsquo;t truly understand how &lt;some lisp function&gt;
works. Space h d f doesn&rsquo;t explain it either.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t understand the question. Am I supposed to relate it to a real life
problem? Am I supposed to compare how &lt;something&gt; acts compared to how
&lt;something else&gt; acts?
</p>

<p>
I  have no idea if this is right. I don&rsquo;t understand what I am doing.
</p>

<p>
I do not understand the question. Why would there &lt;such-and-such&gt;? What is
meant by "the so-and-so"?
</p>

<p>
Seriously, I have no clue what this is even asking. How would anything be
&lt;some description&gt;? This makes no sense whatsoever. I guess I just do not
understand at all what this question is asking.
</p>

<p>
What am I supposed to do when I try and try to understand what it is saying
and I can&rsquo;t make any sense out of it?
</p>

<p>
I do not understand what it means by a function. What is the definition of a
function? I can&rsquo;t find it in the book. It is code or an algorithm that
returns a value (or even multiple values, as I learned in multivariable
calculus)?
</p>

<p>
Oh - I found the definition. A function is an object that takes objects and
gives other objects.

(It might interest you to know that the third student turned his attitude
around and in the end enjoyed the class. The second student did pass on his
second try, but I don&rsquo;t remember whether or not I docked him for not writing
lisp code for that assignment, nor what his final grade was.)
