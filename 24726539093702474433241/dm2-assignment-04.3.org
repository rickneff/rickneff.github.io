#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Wish I had thought of this sooner but thinking back on what Brother Neff was
  talking about earlier this week or last week I can't remember, we should have
  split up sections of the search space for this assignment. If there are 37
  people in the class and each of us were able to verify, say, 3 billion
  numbers, then as a class we could have verified 111 billion. A number like
  that could be closer to Brother Neff's meaning of "many, many"
#+END_QUOTE

  In light of Zach\rsquo{}s comment --- which I heartily endorse --- for your
  consideration, profit and learning, please read [[https://rickneff.github.io/making-zion.html][this excerpt]] from a
  book in my collection.

* Trailer
  Week 04\rsquo{}s assignment --- whose details you will get on Monday during class ---
  is geared to helping you achieve this kind of unity.
