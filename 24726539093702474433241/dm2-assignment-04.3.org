  The task for this week to aimed at helping you maximize your self-assessment
  for the conjecture verifying assignment you started last week and finished
  this week.

* TODO Go Beyond Conjecture Verifying
** Preliminary Considerations

     Let $A = \{ \lfloor n\sqrt{2} \rfloor : n \in {\mathbf Z^+} \}$, and let $B = \{ \lfloor n(2 +
     \sqrt{2}) \rfloor : n \in {\mathbf Z^+} \}$:

    \(\begin{array}{|c|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
    \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  n & {\mathbf 1} & {\mathbf 2} & {\mathbf 3} & {\mathbf 4} & {\mathbf 5} & {\mathbf 6} & {\mathbf 7} & {\mathbf 8} & {\mathbf 9} & {\mathbf 10} & \ldots\\ \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  A & 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 11 & 12 & 14 &\ldots \\
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\  \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  B & 3 & 6 & 10 & 13 & 17 & 20 & 23 & 27 & 30 & 34 &\ldots \\
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\ \hline
    \end{array}\)

    As suggested by the table above, containing just the first ten elements of
    each set, the values not contained in $A$ are contained in $B$, and
    vice-versa. Verifying more and more values (higher $n$) provides more and more
    evidence that these four relationships hold true:

    \(\begin{array}{rcl}
    A \cup B & = & {\mathbf Z^+}\\
    A \cap B & = & \emptyset \\
    \overline{A} & = & B \\
    \overline{B} & = & A \\
    \end{array}\)

    This is the conjecture, that these two sets exhaustively \ldquo{}partition\rdquo the
    positive integers into two disjoint, mutually complementary sets.

    To prove this (not just verify it) we will need a couple more preliminary
    definitions:

    For $x$ a real number, let $\{x\}$ be the fractional part of $x$. For example
    $\{3.14159\} = 0.14159$. Then

    \(\lfloor x \rfloor = x - \{x\}\)

    Let $[booleanExpression]$ mean the value of the C++ expression using the
    ternary conditional operator as follows: $(booleanExpression\ ?\ 1\ :\ 0)$

    In other words, the expression in the square brackets is evaluated, and if its
    value is true, the whole expression, square-brackets and all, is replaced by
    the number 1. If the value is false, it's replaced by 0.

** Going Deeper

     Let \(\mathtt{Num}(X, n) = \) the number of elements in the set X that are
     less than or equal to $n$. The table below shows the first few values:

     | 4 |    5 | 3                      |   13 | 1                      | 4                                           |
     | 5 |    7 | 4                      |   17 | 1                      | 5                                           |
     | 6 |    8 | 4                      |   20 | 2                      | 6                                           |
     | 7 |    9 | 5                      |   23 | 2                      | 7                                           |

     Notice that the values in the first and last columns are the same. If that
     relationship can be shown to always hold, that fact will force the truth of
     the conjecture. Do you see how?

     So how do we prove that this relationship always holds? Following the
     implications of all our definitions (except now letting \(Num(x, n)\) be the
     number of elements of the set /generated by/ $x$ that are less than or equal
     to $n$):

    \(\begin{array}\mathtt{Num}(x, n) & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ \lfloor ix \rfloor \le n\ \right] \\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ \lfloor ix \rfloor < n + 1\ \right] \\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}[\ ix < n + 1\ ]\ \mbox{because}\ (\lfloor a \rfloor < b) \leftrightarrow (a < b)\ \mbox{--- wait, is this justified?}\\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ 0 < i < \frac{n + 1}{x}\ \right]\ \mbox{to make it easier and because we can divide through by}\ x\\
            & = & \left \lfloor \frac{n + 1}{x} \right \rfloor\ \mbox{because the number of integers in the open interval}\ (0, y) = \lfloor y \rfloor.
    \end{array}\)

    The last step is justified as long as $y$ is a noninteger.

    Remember, our conjecture is equivalent to saying $\mathtt{Num}(\sqrt{2}, n)+
    \mathtt{Num}(2 + \sqrt{2}, n) = n$. So plug in $\sqrt{2}$ and $2 + \sqrt{2}$
    for $x$ twice:

    $\mathtt{Num}(\sqrt{2}, n)+ \mathtt{Num}(2 + \sqrt{2}, n) = \left \lfloor
    \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}} \right \rfloor = n$

    $\rightarrow \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} - \left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} +
    \frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}} - \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right\} = n$

    $\rightarrow \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}} -
    \left(\left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} + \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}}\right\}\right) = n$

    $\rightarrow (n + 1)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right) -
    \left(\left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} + \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}}\right\}\right) = n$

    How would you finish this proof?
