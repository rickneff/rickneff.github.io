* Instructions
  Please analyze and reason carefully, making full use of the *mind tools* in
  your possession:

  The philosopher John Locke wrote in 1690 about three mind tools (which he
  called acts) in /An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are
  chiefly these three:

 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex
    ideas are made.
 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and
    setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without
    uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in
    their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general
    ideas are made.
#+END_QUOTE

   Focus particularly on number 2, as you strive to make good connections to
   help make your discrete math learning stick!

** Reading
   Choose one of the following three books to read (parts of) and write about:

   1. [[https://www.math.wustl.edu/~wright/Math109/00Book.pdf][Mathematics and Music]] by David Wright (at least Chapters 1-9).
   2. [[https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/gfologyLinked2.pdf][generatingfunctionology]] by Herbert Wilf (at least Chapters 1-3).
   3. /Random Walks and Diffusions on Graphs and Databases: An Introduction/
      by Philipp Blanchard and Dimitri Volchenkov (read selected chapters
      --- to learn the connection between \radic3 - 1 and ladder graphs).
*** Especially Electrical Resistance Networks
**** The probabilistic interpretation of voltage and current
      --- is fascinating!
***** For the ladder graph connection ---
      Random walks defined on connected undirected graphs have a profound connection
      to electric resistor networks. The effective resistance between two nodes of
      an electric resistor network defined as the potential difference between them
      at a unit current is equal (up to a normalization) to the commute time of a
      random walk between them. The effective resistance distance is bounded above
      by the shortest path distance and equals the shortest path distance only if
      the graph forms a tree, in which any two nodes are connected by the only
      possible path.
** Writing
   Write at least 8 pages (with 12 point font and 1 inch margins) using the
   supplied rubric to guide you to a permutation of a combination of words of
   exceptional quality! Your submission will be hardcopy (your choice how to
   create this document) delivered personally to Brother Neff no later than 5:30
   PM on Thursday, 11 April 2019.

**** Critical Areas
   - Spelling or typo
   - Sentence boundary punctuation (run-ons, comma splices, fused sentences, fragments)
   - Use of apostrophes, -s, and -es
   - Pronoun forms
   - Pronoun agreement, and providing antecedents for pronouns
   - Verb forms and subject-verb agreement
   - Capitalization of proper nouns and of first words in the sentence
