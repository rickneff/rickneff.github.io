  A *planar graph* is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be
  drawn on the plane in such a way that its links intersect only at their
  endpoints. In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no link lines
  cross each other.

  True or false, the RSA graph is a planar graph.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: To save you the trouble of searching, the RSA graph is shown in VWB.
            Also, look at the K_4 graph(s) in VWM before leaping to an erroneous
            conclusion! (The key phrase is \ldquo{}*can* be drawn\rdquo.)

  Armed with a knowledge of what complete graphs (the K_n) are, and what
  subgraphs and graph representations are, you are ready to apply that
  knowledge.

  Another name for a complete graph is a word that in high school is often
  mispronounced as /click/. Making it rhyme with the second syllable of the
  words /antique/ or /technique/ is the correct way to pronounce /clique/.

  Think about how to /verify/ this graph property.

  To give an operational definition, a clique is a subgraph of a given graph in
  which every two nodes are connected by a link. An /anti/-clique is a subgraph
  in which every two nodes are /not/ connected by a link. (Note that this is the
  same as saying that /no/ two nodes in this subgraph are connected. Or in other
  words, they form an /independent set/ of nodes --- nodes that are all
  independent of each other.) Searching through a specified graph, a verifier
  would check the alleged "clique-ness" or "anti-clique-ness" of a given list of
  nodes.

  Use the code below as a starting point. Decide how to represent a graph. Use
  the =link-exists= predicate as is, or change it to suit. If you decide as is
  is good enough, you will still need to implement the =get-adjacency-list=
  function. Test several graphs and various-sized candidate node lists using a
  suitably implemented =check-clique-or-anti-clique= function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun link-exists (graph-representation node1 node2)
    "Given a graph representation, is there a link between node1 and node2?"
    (not
     (null
      (or
       (member node2 (get-adjacency-list graph-representation node1))
       (member node1 (get-adjacency-list graph-representation node2))))))

  (defun check-clique-or-anti-clique (graph-representation nodes anti)
    "Checks if the represented graph contains a subgraph consisting of
  the given nodes that is a clique (if anti is nil) or an anti-clique
  (if anti is t). Returns t or nil appropriately."

** TODO KSI
#+begin_note
  Not to be confused with *graph intersection*, the *intersection graph* of a
  collection of sets A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n is the graph that has a node for each of
  these sets and has a link connecting the nodes representing two sets if these
  sets have a nonempty intersection.

  Construct the intersection graph of this collection of five sets:

  | Set Name | Set Elements       |
  |----------+--------------------|
  | A_1       | [-4 -3 -2 -1 0]    |
  | A_2       | [-2 -1 0 1 2]      |
  | A_3       | [-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6] |
  | A_4       | [-5 -3 -1 1 3 5]   |
  | A_5       | [-6 -3 0 3 6]      |

  Construct a graph using the following list of eight words as node labels:

: dine done gone tine tone wind wine wins

  Link two nodes if they differ in only one letter /in the same position/ (e.g.,
  =wind= and =wins= differ in the fourth letter only, so that defines a link.
  But =dine= and =tone= differ in the first /and/ second letters, so no link
  there).

  Randomly select two nodes of this graph. What is the probability that there is
  a link between those two nodes?

  Generalizing, the Ramsey function /R/ with two parameters, /R(i, j)/, returns
  the minimum /n/ for which in a /K_n/ graph where the links are colored with
  two colors, there must exist either an embedded /K_i/ subgraph whose links are
  all of the first color, or an embedded /K_j/ subgraph whose links are all of
  the second color. As is fairly easily shown, /R(3, 3) = 6/. Many others of
  these so-called /Ramsey numbers/ are known and are provable, e.g., /R(4, 4) =
  18/ and /R(4, 5) = 25/, but most are not. For example, it is known that
  [[R(5, 5) is at least
   43][R(5, 5) is at least 43]] and at most 48, but which number between 43 and 48
  is the exact value is unknown. Why is that? Research and describe why we are
  currently unable to nail this value down.
