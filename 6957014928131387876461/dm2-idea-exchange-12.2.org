* TODO Consider 
  The idea of an Existence Theorem is something you will encounter, perhaps for
  the first time, in this week\rsquo{}s assignment. It\rsquo{}s pretty abstract. Something
  called by the author of [[https://firstthreeodds.org/the-epi-phenomenon.pdf][this document]] an \ldquo{}Abstraction Ceiling\rdquo is something
  you too may have encountered already. Your attempts to understand the
  pigeonhole principle may indeed cause your head to bump against this ceiling
  and cause you some real pain!

  Please read the document linked to above, whose main idea is to describe
  something the author, Douglas R. Hofstadter, calls \ldquo{}The Epi Phenomenon\rdquo. In an
  earlier book, a prequel to the book in which the above is a chapter, he
  describes it as a single word this way (which also gives a glimpse into his
  mind with its wicked wit):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In drawing this Chapter to a close, I would like to relate a story about a
  complex system. I was talking one day with two systems programmers for the
  computer I was using. They mentioned that the operating system seemed to be
  able to handle up to about thirty-five users with great comfort, but at about
  thirty-five users or so, the response time all of a sudden shot up, getting so
  slow that you might as well log off and go home and wait until later. Jokingly
  I said, \ldquo{}Well, that\rsquo{}s simple to fix, just find the place in the operating
  system where the number \lsquo{}35\rsquo is stored, and change it to \lsquo{}60\rsquo{}!\rdquo Everyone
  laughed. The point is, of course, that there is no such place. Where, then,
  does the critical number---35 users---come from? The answer is: /It is a
  visible consequence of the overall system organization---an \ldquo{}epiphenomenon\rdquo./

  Similarly, you might ask about a sprinter, \ldquo{}Where is the \lsquo{}9.3\rsquo stored, that
  makes him be able to run 100 yards in 9.3 seconds?\rdquo Obviously, it is not
  stored anywhere. His time is a result of how he is built, what his reaction
  time is, a million factors all interacting when he runs. The time is quite
  reproducible, but it is not stored in his body anywhere. It is spread around
  among all the cells of his body and only manifests itself in the act of the
  sprint itself.

  Epiphenomena abound. In the game of \ldquo{}Go\rdquo, there is the feature that \ldquo{}two eyes
  live\rdquo. It is not built into the rules, but it is a consequence of the rules.
  In the human brain, there is gullibility. How gullible are you? Is your
  gullibility located in some \ldquo{}gullibility center\rdquo in your brain? Could a
  neurosurgeon reach in and perform some delicate operation to lower your
  gullibility, otherwise leaving you alone? If you believe this, you are pretty
  gullible, and should perhaps consider such an operation.
 #+END_QUOTE

  Hofstadter, hard-core materialist that he is, would scoff at, nay, heap scorn
  on the popular saying:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We are not mortals occasionally having spiritual experiences. We are spiritual
  beings having mortal experiences.
#+END_QUOTE

  You, however, are aware of and know a bit about the larger spiritual reality
  in which we are embedded. Please read [[http://www.ams.org/notices/200707/tx070700852p.pdf][a rebuttal in the form of a review]] of
  his book to see that Hofstadter\rsquo{}s views are easily contested. How would
  you contest them?

* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and discuss these ideas with your peers. 

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students\rsquo{} answers, either adding to their 
  answers, or comparing/contrasting theirs to/with yours.
