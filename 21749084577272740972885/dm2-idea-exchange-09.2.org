* Knowledge and Truth are Ours for the Asking
  Quoting just one of the many great comments I read on last week\rsquo{}s idea
  exchange:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I believe that finding this balance between asking for help and putting in our
  own effort is essential to every problem we will face in our life. --- Chase Jacobs
#+END_QUOTE

  On that note, I will share a lesson from my life many years ago as a software
  engineer working for an internet startup.

  I had a problem. I don't remember the details, but it had something to do with
  cookies and cross-site concerns, which I knew nothing about until I came to
  work for this company. (The internet was still getting off the ground when I
  was in grad school.)

  I was not finding a solution, despite my best efforts. I suspected a
  colleague, Bret, who I had worked with before at two previous companies, could
  help me find the answer. But I wanted to figure it without consulting with
  someone else, even someone I admired and respected like Bret.

  I remember thinking, and eventually admitting to myself, I am stuck! I prayed
  fervently, \ldquo{}Heavenly Father, please help me find the solution to this
  problem.\rdquo The answer came: \ldquo{}Go ask Bret!\rdquo I was not happy. Why? I knew that I
  *should* go ask him, but I did not want to display my weakness, my inability
  to figure it out on my own. I had to swallow my pride. Compounding my stubborn
  lack of humility was the nagging \lsquo{}natural man\rsquo thought that I distinctly
  remember thinking: \ldquo{}I have a PhD in Computer Science. I should not have to ask
  someone who only has a Bachelor's degree in CS for help with this.\rdquo But I did
  manage to humble myself sufficiently. I went to talk to Bret and ask for his
  help, and you know what? He saw the solution immediately! We both rejoiced
  that the problem was solved, and never again did I repeat that mistake of
  *persisting*, after all I could do by my own efforts, to go it alone when
  faced with a difficult problem!

  So here again is the question each of you should ask yourself: Why Am I Here?
  (Meaning here at BYU-Idaho.)

  722 is the code of the appropriate TLA to succinctly answer that question, and
  as I urged you in class a couple of weeks ago, you should *diligently strive*
  to answer that question for yourself, and the sooner the better. I gave you
  one scripture, Luke 22:32, to get you started. Here is another: Doctrine and
  Covenants 84:106.

  You will find further light and knowledge by pondering BYU-Idaho's definition
  of an \ldquo{}A\rdquo student (which you all aspire to be, neh?!), namely:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [one who demonstrates] outstanding understanding, application, and integration
  of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use
  of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates
  diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in
  serving other students.
#+END_QUOTE

  Regarding \ldquo{}initiative in serving other students,\rdquo quoting Truman Madsen
  (quoting the Prophet Joseph Smith): Now one of the strongest and wisest
  statements I have ever heard on egoism. The question was put to him, \ldquo{}Joseph,
  is the principle of self-aggrandizement wrong? Should we seek our own good?\rdquo
  Listen to his answer. \ldquo{}It is a correct principle and may be indulged upon only
  one rule or plan --- and that is to elevate, benefit, and bless others first.
  If you will elevate others, the very work itself will exalt you. Upon no other
  plan can a man justly and permanently aggrandize himself.\rdquo

* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and further discuss these ideas in the context of what you have
  achieved (or will have achieved) regarding this week\rsquo{}s assignment. Focus
  particularly on the truth of what 722 represents in the context of data
  compression and the unique challenges of doing it per the requirements.

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students\rsquo{} answers, either adding to their 
  answers, or comparing/contrasting theirs to/with yours.
