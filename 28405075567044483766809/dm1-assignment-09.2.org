* Exercises
** TODO LDA
#+begin_note
  Alter the following =let= expression so that it creates the same list using
  =cons= rather than =list=.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results raw
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (d 4))
    (list (+ a b) (/ d b) (- d a) (* c d)))
#+END_SRC

** TODO SQI
#+begin_note
  Use =cons= to re-implement the =morphifyr= function more efficiently.
#+end_note
#+begin_info

#+end_info
** TODO LJP
#+begin_note
  Use =car=, =cdr=, and =cons= to re-implement the =prime-list-from-rle-list=
  function more efficiently.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Think recursion. There are four cases to handle, the base case being
            when the passed-in rle-list is null.

** TODO YGT
#+begin_note
  Construct a binary search tree from the *words* (not the letters) of the phrase

: time flies on wings of lightning

  using dictionary order, inserting words in the order they appear in the
  phrase. Don\rsquo{}t try to balance the tree (see below).

  What is the *height* of this tree?

** TODO LUM
#+begin_note
  Which of the above balanced BSTs is represented by the following list?
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (so (cool (are (and) (binary)) (search (kind))) (trees (the) (wonderfully)))))

* Problems
  No optional problems this week.
** TODO SUF
#+begin_note
  How would you write (using map /not/ a loop) an elisp function
  =number-of-factors= that takes the CSF of a positive integer (in
  list-of-dotted-pairs form) and returns how many factors that integer has?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun number-of-factors (csf)
    "Takes a CSF like '((2 . 3) (3 . 1) (5 . 2)) and returns 24."
    ;; ... your ONE line of code goes here
    )

** TODO LNR
#+begin_note
  How would you write (using map /not/ a loop) another elisp function
  =number-of-factors-alt= that takes the CSF of a positive integer (in
  vector-of-two-element-lists form) and returns how many factors that integer
  has?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun number-of-factors-alt (csf)
    "Takes a CSF like [(2 3) (3 1) (5 2)] and returns 24."
    ;; ... your ONE line of code goes here
    )

** TODO LDO
#+begin_note
  Investigate what must happen to delete a key from a BST. Is deletion always as
  fast as insertion?

#+begin_info

#+end_info
** TODO YCF
#+begin_note
  Compare and contrast the different nuances in the precise definitions of the
  terms *full*, *complete* and *balanced* used to describe trees.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Your answer goes here.
#+end_info
** TODO YZU
#+begin_note
  Investigate various techniques to rebuild unbalanced BSTs to make them
  balanced. Note that this rebuilding can happen on-the-fly (as items are
  inserted) or at-the-end (after all initial items are inserted).
