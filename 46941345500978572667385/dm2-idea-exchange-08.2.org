* Consistently Pursuing Knowledge and Truth 
  Continuing the pursuit, the notion of \ldquo{}fake it til you make it\rdquo (in the right
  way) as a popular way to put it, I believe that applying the \ldquo{}as if\rdquo principle
  is one way to exercise the kind of faith in prayer the Savior was talking
  about when he said: \ldquo{}Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;
  And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing
  that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you\rdquo (3 Nephi 18:19-20).

  From the /Bible Dictionary/ entry on /Prayer/ (pages 752-753) comes this gem
  of logical reasoning that rings absolutely true:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child
  are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not
  to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others
  blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional
  on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part
  before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work, and is an appointed means
  for obtaining the highest of all blessings.

  \dots We pray in Christ\rsquo{}s name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes
  the wishes of Christ --- when his words abide in us (John 15: 7). We then ask
  for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered
  because they are not in Christ\rsquo{}s name at all; they in no way represent his
  mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man\rsquo{}s heart.
#+END_QUOTE

  The mind of Christ perfectly reflects his wishes, the desires of his heart ---
  as he revealed to Abraham: \ldquo{}\dots there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall
  take in his heart to do but what he will do it.\rdquo --- Abraham 3:17

  He does what he desires, and he desires nothing but good: \ldquo{}He doeth not
  anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world,
  even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.\rdquo
  --- 2 Nephi 26:24

  Consider this thought from then Elder Howard W. Hunter from his BYU Devotional
  address titled \ldquo{}Fear Not Little Flock\rdquo on 14 March 1989:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Please remember this one thing. If our lives and our faith are
  centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever
  go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not
  centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever
  be permanently right.
#+END_QUOTE

  This is real. This is right and true. This I know.

* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and further discuss these ideas in the context of what you have
