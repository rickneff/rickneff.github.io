Groucho Marx once quipped, "Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best
friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read." <a href="#orgtarget1">This book is not
about that kind of word play</a>. (These are not the droids you're
looking for. Move on.) But it <i>will</i> have something to say about
<i>Outside</i> versus <i>Inside</i> in a logical context later on.
</p>

<p>
Kith and kin to word play is the idea of transformation, new from
old. Old is known, new unknown. The unknown is daunting unless and
until it becomes known. And the becoming process is called learning,
a transformation from an old state of (less) knowledge to a new state
of (more) knowledge.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The field of knowledge called discrete mathematics is <b>HUGE</b> &#x2014;
and no wonder; it is like a catch-all net. Anything not
contemplated by mathematics of the continuous variety (calculus and
company) is considered discrete (but not discreet). So narrowing
the scope is a challenge of near epic proportions &#x2014; met by
allowing the following topic pairs to serve as guideposts as we
venture out into this vast field.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Sets and Logic</li>
<li>Functions and Relations</li>
<li>Combinatorics and Probability</li>
<li>Number Theory and Practice</li>
<li>Trees and Graphs</li>
<li>Languages and Grammars</li>
</ol>

<p>
Functions (which build on sets (which build on logic)) embody
transformations. These are natural, foundational topics in a study
of discrete mathematics. And to provide a transformative learning
experience, functional programming (the oft-neglected (by most
students) odd duck of the programming world) will be a particular
focus of this work.
</p>

<p>
There are two main reasons to gain experience with the functional
paradigm. One, functional programming <a href="#orgtarget2">rounds out the dyad</a>
of procedural and object-oriented programming, presumably already
in the typical programmer's toolbox. Two, learning functional
programming is a natural way to learn discrete mathematics,
especially since functions are a key aspect, and illuminate many
other aspects of discrete mathematics.
</p>

<p>
For reasons revealed &agrave; la <a href="#orgtarget3">Isaiah 28:10</a>, the language of choice for
learning functional programming will be the <b>lisp</b> programming
language, specifically the Emacs lisp (elisp) dialect. Why lisp,
certainly, but especially why elisp? To forestall unbearable
suspense, let's dispense with the knee-jerk objection that elisp is
not a <b>pure</b> functional programming language. With discipline it
can be used as such, and the effort will be instructive.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgtarget4">A quick review and preview</a>:
</p>

<td class="org-left">Code is stateless (function calls can be replaced by their return values without changing program behavior).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Functions are partial (not defined on all inputs, so exceptions can be thrown).</td>
<td class="org-left">Same as Procedural.</td>
<td class="org-left">Functions are total (defined on all inputs, so exceptions are not thrown, and need not be handled.)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The above table doesn't capture all the distinctions in this
three-way comparison, but one thing is obvious. When looked at
through the functional lens, procedural and object-oriented are the
same. What then distinguishes them? Mainly what types can
be the values of variables. Object-oriented adds user-defined types
to the standard primitives and composites of procedural.
</p>

<p>
P-L and O-O also differ on how they treat nouns and verbs. It gets
pretty topsy-turvy when normal everyday distinctions between nouns
(things) and verbs (actions) are blurred. When not only do nouns get
verbed, but verbs get nouned, we have a double play on words!
</p>

<p>
Speaking of double, combinatorics, the study of combining, or
counting, and number theory, the study of integers (useful for
counting &#x2014; especially the positive ones) are an integral &#9786;
part of discrete math. How many ways are there of combining things
in various combinations? Variations, arrangements, shufflings &#x2014;
these are things that must be accounted for in the kind of careful
counting that is foundational for discrete probability theory. But
they also come into play in modern practices of number theory like
cryptology, the study of secret messages.
</p>

<p>
Double encore: two more discrete structures, with a cornucopia of
applications, are trees and their generalization, graphs. Trees and
graphs are two of the most versatile and useful data structures ever
invented, and will be explored in that light.
</p>

<p>
Teaser begin, a <b>binary</b> tree &#x2014; perhaps the type easiest to
understand &#x2014; can represent <a href="#orgtarget5">any conceptual (as opposed to
botanical) tree</a> whatsoever. How to do so takes us into deep
representational waters, but we'll proceed carefully. And because
graphs can represent relations, listed above in conjunction with
functions, they truly are rock solid stars of math and computer
science. The relationship between functions and relations is like
that of trees and graphs, and when understood leads to starry-eyed
wonder, end teaser.
</p>

<p>
Last double: finishing off and rounding out this relatively small
set of topics is the dynamic duo, languages and grammars. Language
is being used, rather prosaically, as a vehicle for communication,
even as I write these words, and you read them. There is fascinating
scientific evidence for the facility of language being innate,
inborn, a human instinct. Steven Pinker, who literally wrote the
book on this, calls language a "discrete combinatorial system",
which is why it makes total sense that it be in this book and
beyond.
</p>

<p>
And what is grammar? Pinker in his book is quick to point out what
it is not. Nags such as "Never end a sentence with a preposition,"
"Don't dangle participles," and (my personal favorite) "To ever
split an infinitive &#x2014; anathema!" Such as these are what you may
have learned in "grammar school" as teachers tried their best to
drill into you how to use good English. No doubt my English teachers
would cringe at reading the last phrase of the last sentence of the
last paragraph, where "it" is used in two different ways, and "this
book" can ambiguously refer to more than one referent &#x2014; think
about it.
</p>

<p>
No, in the context of discrete mathematics, grammar has nothing to
do with proper English usage. Instead, a grammar (note the
indefinite article) is a <b>generator</b> of the discrete combinations
of the language system. These generated combinations are called
<b>phrase structures</b> (as opposed to word structures), hence, in this
sense grammars are more precisely known as <b>phrase structure
grammars</b>. But we're getting ahead of ourselves &#x2014; <a href="#orgtarget6">PSG ISA TLA TBE l8r</a>.

<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Autobiographical Aside</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
I am writing this book for many reasons, which mostly relate to the
following language-ish math-ish relationships and transformations:
Words have Letters, Numbers have Digits, Letters map to Digits,
hence Words map to Numbers.
</p>

<p>
I love words. I love numbers. Does that mean English was my first
choice of discipline, Math second? No! English is my native tongue,
but Math to me feels PRE native, or the language I came into this
world furnished with. Not that I lay claim to being a mathematical
prodigy like Fredrich Gauss, John Von Neumann, or any extraordinary
human like that. Not even close!
</p>

<p>
A first recollection of my inchoate interest in math is from third
grade. There I was, standing at the blackboard, trying to figure
out multiplication. The process was mysterious to me, even with my
teacher right there patiently explaining it. But her patience paid
off, and when I "got it" the thrill was electrifying! Armed with a
memorized times table, I could wield the power of this newly
acquired understanding. Much later in life came the realization
that I could immensely enjoy helping others acquire understanding
and thus wield power!
</p>

<p>
Back to words. As I said, I love them. I love the way words work. I
love the way they look. I love the way they sound. Part of this
stems from my love of music, especially vocal music. Singers pay
attention to nuances of pronunciation, <a href="#orgtarget7">5</a> being but one
example. Take another example. The rule for pronouncing the e in
the. Is it ee or uh? It depends not on the look of the next word
but its sound. The honorable wants ee not uh because the aitch is
silent. The Eternal, but the One &#x2014; ee, uh. Because one is
actually won.
</p>

<p>
The attentive reader may have noticed that, among other
infelicities, the preceding paragraph plays fast and loose with
<b>use</b> versus <b>mention</b>. There is a distinction to be made between
the use of a word, and the mention of a word.
</p>

<p>
For example, the word <b>Idaho</b>:
</p>

<p>
Idaho has mountains. (A use of the word.)
</p>

<p>
'Idaho' has five letters. (A mention of the word.)
</p>

<p>
This distinction will come to the fore when expressions in a
programming language like lisp must be precisely formed and
evaluated. The quote marks are all-important. Small marks, big
effect.
</p>

<p>
Analogously, what importance does a simple preposition have? How
about the crucial difference between being saved <b>in</b> your sins
versus being saved <b>from</b> your sins! Small words, enormous effect.
</p>

<p>
I have a well-nigh fanatical fondness for the English alphabet with
its 26 letters. 26 is 2 times 13. 2 and 13 are both prime, which is
cool enough, but they're also my birth month and day. And it's
unambiguous which is which. 2/13 or 13/2 &#x2014; take your
pick. Because there's no thirteenth month, either way works. Not
every birth date is so lucky! <a href="#orgtarget8">Not every language's alphabet is so easy</a>, either.
</p>

<p>
Despite the coolness of twice a baker's dozen, it is deficient by
one of being an even cooler multiple of three, and that's a state
of affairs we'll not long tolerate. But which non-alphabetic (and
non-numeric) symbol is best pressed into service to bring the
number to three cubed?

Twenty-seven is three times nine. Nine give or take three is the
number of main topics. Three chapters (not counting opening and
closing bookends), with each chapter having at least three
sections, each section having at least three subsections &#x2014;
perhaps bottoming out at this level &#x2014; this seems to me to be a
pretty good organization.
</p>

<p>
Slice it. Dice it. No matter how you whatever ice it &#x2014; notice
it's not ice (but is it water &#x2014; whatever hve u dehydrated?!) &#x2014;
'<a href="#orgtarget9">alphabet</a>' is one letter shy of being a <i>concatenation</i>
(smooshing together) of the first two letters of some other
(which?) alphabet. So correct its shyness (and yours). Say
alphabeta. Go ahead, say it! Now say ALP HAB ETA (each is
pronounceable) &#x2014; but don't expect anyone to understand what you
just said!

<p>
The Organizing Principle I have chosen for this book is the
Three-Letter Acronym.
</p>

<p>
Why? Well, it fully fascinates me that "TLA ISA" is a perfectly
grammatical sentence if interpreted just so. It expresses concisely
the truth: 'TLA' "self-describes" (which is another intriguing
saying).
</p>

<p>
But TLA can also stand for Three-Letter Abbreviation, of which
there are many, <code>(JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC)</code>
being but one example.
</p>

<p>
Replacing the 'A' in TLA with a 'W' gives TLW, an acronym for
Three-Letter Word &#x2014; <code>(TOP TOE TON TOT TOY)</code> for a butcher's
half-dozen of which.
</p>

<p>
Note that we could generate this list by simply prefixing <code>TO</code> to
each letter in <a href="#orgtarget10"><code>PENTY</code>, a carefully chosen way to code-say Christmas</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note too that neither this list of five TLWs nor the first list of
twelve TLAs has commas, those typical list item separators. The
comma-free rendering is deliberate and significant, as will be
seen.
</p>

<p>
Back to playing with words. If you can eat your words, shouldn't
you be able to smell and taste them too?! Or play with words like
you play with your food? (These are rhetorical questions &#x2014;
don't try to answer them!)
</p>

<p>
Scrambled <code>EGGS</code> &#x2014; <code>(GSGE GESG SGEG ...)</code>
</p>

<p>
Can all 12 (not 24! (which is NOT to say 24 factorial (which equals
620448401733239439360000, <a href="#orgtarget11">IYI</a>))) arrangements be put into
one tetragramamalgam? What's a tetragramamalgam? (These are
NOT rhetorical questions &#x2014; DO try to answer them!)
</p>

<p>
So there you have it. An assorted set of words and "words" to guide
discovery. Many to unpack meaning from. If the metaphor is a good
one, that meaning gets packed into words, (or encodings thereof
(another layer of packing material)), then unpacking can result in
rich interconnected structures that strengthen learning, that make
it stick in the brain. And that that permanently (it is hoped)
stuck learning will serve you well <a href="#orgtarget12">is my high hope</a>.

<a href="#orgtarget13">He awoke with a start</a>. What time was it? &#x2026; Did his alarm
not go off? &#x2026; No, it was 3:45, he just woke up too early. He lay
there, mind racing, trying to figure out what had woken him up. His
wife was breathing deeply, she was sound asleep, so it wasn't her
stirring. No &#x2026; it was that dream. That awesome, awefull dream
where he was outside staring into the clear night sky, basking in
"the icy air of night" when suddenly he felt a very real vertigo, as
if he were falling <i>up</i> into that endless star-sprinkled void.
</p>

<p>
Falling up. A contradiction in terms. Yes, but one to be embraced,
not shunned, because it gives one an <a href="#orgtarget14">EDGE</a>. No, this is the title of
a book. Yes, that treasured book <a href="#orgtarget15">he had acquired years ago</a>, and
still enjoyed. Clever poems and cute drawings. It was because the
author was so playful with words and the thoughts they triggered
that he liked it, and his other book, what was it?  Where The
Sidewalk Ends. Yes, well, enough of that. He would have to get up
soon. Today he would meet his two new tutees. TWOtees for short. A
male and a female had seen his ad and responded. Was he expecting
more than two to? Yes &#x2026; but two would be fine. Two would be enough
to keep him busy.
</p>

<p>

<p>
"What I'd like to do today is just make introductions and see where
we're at," he said. "My name is Tiberius Ishmael Luxor, but you can
call me Til. T-I-L, my initials, my preference." While escorting his
two visitors into his study, his mind wandered, as it always did
when he introduced himself. Tiberius, why had his parents, fervent
fans of Captain Kirk and all things Star Trek, named him that? And
Ishmael? Was Moby Dick also a source of inspiration? Or the Bible?
He had never asked them, to his regret. Luxor, of course, was not a
name they had chosen. He rather liked his family name. The first
three letters, anyway. Latin for light. He often played with Luxor
by asking himself, Light or what? Darkness? Heavy? Going with the
other meaning of light seemed frivolous.
</p>

<p>
"Uh, my name's Atticus. Atticus Bernhold Ushnol," his male visitor
said, noticing that Til looked distracted. "What do you prefer we
call you?" asked Til, jerking himself back to full attention. "Well,
I like Abu, if that's okay with you!"
</p>

<p>
Til smiled. A man after his own heart. "How acronymenamored of
you!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Is that even a word?" asked his female guest, addressing
Til. Feeling just a little annoyed, she turned to Abu and said "You
really want us to call you the name of the monkey in Aladdin?" Abu
smiled, a crooked grin. "Well, I wouldn't know about that &#x2014; I
never saw Aladdin."
</p>

<p>
"How could you not have seen Aladdin? What planet are you from?"
she said, completely incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on a minute," said Til. "Let's discuss the finer points of
names and origins after you introduce yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Ila. My middle name is my maiden name, Bowen. My last name is my
married name, Toopik, which I suppose I'm stuck with." Ila always
felt irritated that marriage traditionally involved changing the
woman's name, not the man's. "And yes, it's Eee-la, not Eye-la. And
I especially prefer you don't call me Ibt, if you get my drift!"
</p>

<p>
Til laughed. Abu was still grinning but said nothing, so Til went
on. "We need variety, so Ila is fine. Not everyone needs to be
acronymized!"
</p>

<p>
-~-~-~-~-~-
</p>

<p>
Later that day as Til reflected on their first meeting, he saw
himself really enjoying the teacher-learner interactions to
come. His ad had had the intended effect. Abu and Ila were
motivated learners, albeit for different reasons. He was somewhat
surprised that not more interest had been generated. But he knew it
was unlikely up front. So two it would be. Two is a good
number. Three is even better (odd better?) if he counted himself as
a learner. Which he always did. Learning and teaching were
intricately intertwined in his mind. Teaching was like breathing,
and both teaching and learning were exhilarating to Til.
</p>

<p>
His wife interrupted his reverie. "Til, dear, what did you learn
today from your first meeting with &#x2014; what did you call them &#x2014;
Abu and Ila?"
</p>

<p>
"Interesting things," said Til. "Abu is the general manager at a
landscaping company (I think he said nursery as well). Ila works
for some web design company (I forget the name) doing programming.
She wants to learn discrete math because she's been told it will
make her a better programmer!"
</p>

<p>
"However, Abu's not a programmer, and not really all that techy, I
gathered, but says he <i>loves</i> learning, practical or not. I
predict this may put him at odds at times with Ila, who said she
<i>only</i> wants practical learning. I told her Euclid would mock
that attitude, and she was surprised. But she agreed to look into
that. She didn't know who Euclid was, if you can imagine!" Til
winked his eye, and his wife rolled hers.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, Abu's pretty laid back, so her barbs won't bother him &#x2014;
much I hope," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Are they married, any kids?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Abu is single, but would like to be married." Til rubbed his
chin. "Ila is married, but she didn't mention her husband's name, or
really anything about him, except that he's not a nerd like
her. Before they even warmed up to my affinity for acronyms, Ila
confessed to being a <a href="#orgtarget16">DINK</a>, and Abu immediately responded, 'I guess
that makes me a <a href="#orgtarget17">SINKNEM</a>!' So he's pretty quick on the uptake."
</p>

<p>
"That's good!" she said. "So Ila's husband is not nerdy like her,
but &#x2026;?"
</p>

<p>
"But she also didn't say what he does," he said. "She taught herself
programming, how cool is that?!"
</p>

<p>
"Very cool, Mr. Luxor," she said affectionately, gently rubbing
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Luxor, I'll give you 20 minutes to stop that!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"What are their interests other than discrete math?" she said,
ignoring his pathetic ploy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's see, Abu rattled off his other interests as flowers,
stars and poetry!" he said.  "And Ila likes sports and the
outdoors. Hopefully that includes stars!"
</p>

<p>
"That would be great if you all have stars in common," she said.
</p>

<p>
Til nodded, but his eyes unfocused as his thoughts started to
wander. His wife withdrew, wordlessly worrying that Til was thinking
about sharing his dream about falling up into the stars with Abu and
Ila. That never seemed to go well. But Til was remembering the
exchange he had with Abu, who lingered a few minutes after Ila left.
</p>

<p>
He had said, "Abu, since you like flowers, you must be okay with
the <a href="#orgtarget18">STEM</a>less reputation they have!" Without waiting for
him to answer he went on, "Since I gave Ila an invitation to learn
something about Euclid, I invite you to look up what Richard
Feynman said about flowers and science, specifically whether
knowing the science made him <a href="#orgtarget19">appreciate the flowers more or less?</a>"
</p>

<p>
Well, enough musing for now. His two tutees were eager and
grateful, and not just because they thought the fee he had set was
reasonable. Little did they know the price of knowledge he would
exact of them.

When you read you begin with A, B, C; when you sing you begin with
Do, Re, Mi; when you count you begin with 1, 2, 3 &#x2014; or is it 0,
1, 2?! Mathematicians do both, and have logical reasons for
each. Computer scientists mainly do zero-based counting, as coaxed
to do by both hardware and software. 0-1-2; ready-set-goo!
</p>

<p>
So let's begin with the set of positive integers, also known as the
counting numbers &#x2014; except, wait. How do you count the number of
elements in the set with no elements, <a href="#orgtarget20">AKA</a> the empty set?
You need zero, which for centuries was not even considered a
number. Lucky for us, these days zero is a full-fledged member of
the set of <b>natural</b> numbers, another name for the counting
numbers. But some still see zero as UNnatural and thus exclude it
from the set. Right away, ambiguity rears its hoary head, and
definitions must needs be clarified before crafting arguments that
depend on whether zero is in or out.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgtarget21">VTO</a>: a <b>set</b> is just a <b>collection</b> of <b>objects</b>, where
objects are individual, discrete, separate things that can be named
or identified somehow. A collection that serves <a href="#orgtarget22">the mathematical idea of a set</a>
is an <b>unordered</b> one &#x2014; the elements can be listed in any order
and it doesn't change the set.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of lists, LISP originally stood for LISt Processor (or
Processing), so let's list some simple sets in lisp style, and show
a side-by-side comparison with math style:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="all" frame="border">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">(0 1 2)</td>
<td class="org-left">{0, 1, 2, &#x2026;}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Other than <a href="#orgtarget23">dispensing with commas</a> and replacing curly
braces with parentheses, lisp is just like math &#x2014; except,
wait. What are those three dots saying? In math, the ellipsis (&#x2026;)
is short for "and so on" which means "continue this way
forever". Since lisp is a computer programming language, where
doing things forever is a bad idea, <a href="#orgtarget24">we truncated the set <b>N</b></a>
after listing its first three members.
</p>

<p>
Also, no duplicates are allowed in sets. This requirement
guarantees element uniqueness, a desirable attribute strangely
yoked with element unorderliness, the other main
(anti-)constraint. Here are three lispy sets (really lists):
</p>

<pre class="example">
(A B C) (A A B C) (A A A B C C)
</pre>

<p>
Here are three more:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(B A C) (C A B) (B C A)
</pre>

<p>
But by definition these are all the same set &#x2014; <code>(A B C)</code> &#x2014; so
let's just make it a rule to quash duplicates when listing
sets. And since order is implied by the normal left-to-right
listing order, we have a contradictory situation where order is
implied yet irrelevant. That really implies (linked) lists are not
the ideal data structure for representing sets, and (linkless)
vectors in elisp are no better &#x2014; they are simply indexable arrays
of (heterogeneous or homogeneous) elements &#x2014; but let's say
<a href="#orgtarget25">our rule also prefers</a> vectors to lists. So the rule
transforms a mathy set like {A, C, C, C, B} into a lisp list <code>(A C
   B)</code> and thence to the vector <code>[A C B]</code>, which is now in a form that
can be evaluated by the lisp interpreter built into emacs (a later
lesson shows how lists can be evaluated too):
</p>

<p>
VTO: an <b>expression</b> expresses some value in some syntactic form,
and to <b>evaluate</b> means to reduce an expression to its value (for
the purpose of <a href="#orgtarget26">handing it off to some further processing step</a>).
</p>

<p>
We next turn our attention to a way to view statements about sets
as <b>propositions</b> with <a href="#orgtarget27">Boolean values</a> (true or false). In lisp,
true is abbreviated <b>t</b>, and false <b>nil</b>. With some help from a
pair of global variables, we can be traditional and <a href="#orgtarget28">just use true
and false</a>.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a <b>proposition</b> is a sentence (or statement) that is either
true or false. The sentence can be about anything at all (not just
sets), as long as ascertaining its truth or falsity is
feasible. The study called <b>propositional logic</b> deals with
standalone and compound propositions, which are propositions
composed of other propositions, standalone or themselves
composite. How to compose or combine propositions to create these
compounds is coming after a few exercises in model building. Do
start the warmup by thinking up three examples and three
non-examples of propositions. Make them pithy.
</p>

<p>
True propositions are AKA <b>facts</b>. A set of true propositions is
called a knowledge base, which is just a database of facts. This
set represents what we know about the world (or a subset of the
world) or, in other words, the meaning or interpretation we attach
to symbols (such as sentences &#x2014; strings of words). Take a simple
two-proposition world:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is true that snow is white.</li>
<li>It is false that grass is white.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given our propensity for abbreviation, let's assign propositional
variables <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> to make it easier to manipulate this world:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>p</code> = "snow is white"</li>
<li><code>q</code> = "grass is white"</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>p and not q</code> represents our interpretation of this world. We could
imagine a stranger world &#x2014; stranger than the <b>real</b> one where we
live &#x2014; where <code>p and q</code> (i.e., where snow is white and so is
grass) or even <code>not p and q</code> (where snow is green, say, and grass
is white) is the real model.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a <b>model</b> is (roughly speaking) the meanings (interpretations)
of symbols. In general, a model is all over the map, but in
propositional logic, models are assignments of truth values to
propositions (conveniently identified as variables). As
aforementioned, truth values are Boolean values, true or
false. Period. No partly true or somewhat false, nor any other
<a href="#orgtarget29">kind of wishy-washiness</a>.
</p>

<p>
Decision-making ability is an important component of any
programming language. Lisp is no exception. The conditional logic
<i>decidering</i> of one of the basic logical connectives will be
revealed in the following exercise that invites you to explore the
logical connectives <code>and</code> (&and;), <code>or</code> (&or;), <code>xor</code> (&oplus;), and
<code>not</code> (&not;). Naturally, <code>not</code> is not a connective in the sense of
connecting two things together, but it's a logical operator
nonetheless. For <code>xor</code>, <a href="#orgtarget30">the 'exclusive' or</a>, use the <code>if</code> form to do
a conditional expression.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2</span> MOQ</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
We can compose or combine propositions to create compound
propositions by applying the following rules again and again
(consider this a 'grammar' for generating these propositional
'molecules' from propositional 'atoms'):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A <code>proposition</code> is a variable, that is, a single element from
the set <code>[p q r s t ...]</code>;</li>
<li>alternatively, a <code>proposition</code> is a <code>proposition</code> preceded by a
<code>not</code>;</li>
<li>alternatively, a <code>proposition</code> is a <code>proposition</code> followed by a
<code>connective</code> followed by a <code>proposition</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>connective</code> is a single element from the set <code>[and or xor]</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Rules 2 and 3 have a <i>recursive</i> flavor, so said because they
refer back to themselves; that is, they define a proposition in
terms of itself, and <a href="#orgtarget31">simpler versions of itself</a>.
</p>

<p>
We actually need more syntactic structure to make sense of certain
compounds. For example, building a proposition from scratch by
starting with
</p>

<p>
<code>proposition</code>;
</p>

<p>
from thence applying rule 1 (choosing <code>p</code>) then rule 3 yields
</p>

<p>
<code>p connective proposition</code>;
</p>

<p>
from thence applying rule 4 (choosing <code>and</code>) yields;
</p>

<p>
<code>p and proposition</code>;
</p>

<p>
from thence applying rule 3 again yields
</p>

<p>
<code>p and proposition connective proposition</code>;
</p>

<p>
from thence applying 1 twice and 2 once yields
</p>

<p>
<code>p and q connective not r</code>;
</p>

<p>
from thence one more application of 4 (choosing <code>or</code>) yields the
not-further-expandable:
</p>

<p>
<code>p and q or not r</code>
</p>

<p>
Which is ambiguous. Does it mean <code>p</code> and <code>s</code> where <code>s</code> is <code>q</code> or
<code>not r</code>? Or does it mean <code>s or not r</code> where <code>s</code> is <code>p and q</code>? In
other words, which is the right interpretation, 1 or 2?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>p and (q or not r)</code>; associating from the right.</li>
<li><code>(p and q) or not r</code>; associating from the left.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The mathematically astute reader will recognize that the
parentheses are the extra syntactic sugar we need to sprinkle on
to disambiguate (choose 1 or 2 (but not both)).
</p>

<p>
The next question is, does it matter? Try it both ways with the
truth-value assignment of <code>p</code> to <code>true</code>, <code>q</code> to <code>false</code>, and <code>r</code>
to <code>true</code>:
</p>

<p>
Replacing <code>p</code>, <code>q</code>, and <code>r</code> with <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>true</code>,
respectively, in
</p>

<p>
<code>p and (q or not r)</code>
</p>

<p>
yields
</p>

<p>
<code>true and (false or not true)</code>
</p>

<p>
Before simplifying this expression, a quick review of how these
connectives work:
</p>

<p>
The simplest one first: <code>not</code> flips truth values &#x2014; when notted
(or negated &#x2014; <code>not</code> is AKA negation) true becomes false, false
becomes true. To be true, <code>or</code> requires at least one of the two
propositions appearing on its left-hand-side (LHS) and its
right-hand-side (RHS) to be true. If both of them are false, their
disjunction (a fancier name for <code>or</code>) is false. To be true, <code>and</code>
requires both propositions (LHS and RHS) to be true. If even one
of them is false, their conjunction (a fancier name for <code>and</code>) is
false.
</p>

<p>
Back to the task: the above expression simplifies to
</p>

<p>
<code>true and (false or false)</code>
</p>

<p>
from thence to
</p>

<p>
<code>true and false</code>
</p>

<p>
from thence to
</p>

<p>
<code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
Replacing propositional variables with their values in
</p>

<p>
<code>(p and q) or not r</code>
</p>

<p>
yields
</p>

<p>
<code>(true and false) or not true</code>
</p>

<p>
which simplifies to
</p>

<p>
<code>(true and false) or false</code>
</p>

<p>
from thence to
</p>

<p>
<code>false or false</code>
</p>

<p>
and finally
</p>

<p>
<code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
So they're the same. But wait! What if we try a different
assignment of truth values? With all of <code>p</code>, <code>q</code> and <code>r false</code>, here is
the evolving evaluation for 1 <code>(p and (q or not r))</code>:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>false and (false or not false)</code></li>
<li><code>false and (false or true)</code></li>
<li><code>false and true</code></li>
<li><code>false</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
And here it is for 2 <code>((p and q) or not r)</code>:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>(false and false) or not false</code></li>
<li><code>false or not false</code></li>
<li><code>false or true</code></li>
<li><code>true</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
So it's different &#x2014; it DOES matter which form we choose. Let's
tabulate all possible truth-value assignments (AKA models) for
each, and see how often they're the same or not:
</p>

<p>
First, how do we generate all possible assignments? Let's use a decision tree:
</p>

<pre class="example">
       p     q     r
   / false false false
  /\ false false true
 /\/ false true  false
/  \ false true  true
\  / true  false false
 \/\ true  false true
  \/ true  true  false
   \ true  true  true
</pre>

<p>
In this binary tree, each <b>node</b> (wherever it branches up or down)
represents a decision to be made. Branching up represents a choice of
false, branching down true. Going three levels (branch, twig,
leaf) gives us the <a href="#orgtarget32">eight possibilities</a>.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a tabulation of possible models (essentially picking off the
leaves of the tree from top to bottom (making each leaf a row)) is
called a <b>truth table</b>. Here's an example:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="all" frame="border">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-center" />

Numerically it makes sense to have, and indeed most other languages
do have, 0 represent <code>false</code>. Lisp is an exception &#x2014; 0 evaluates
to non-nil (which is not nil &#x2014; not <code>false</code>). Having 1 represent
<code>true</code> has advantages, too, although MOL treat anything non-zero as
<code>true</code> as well. Still, it's less typing, so we'll use it to save
space &#x2014; but keep in mind, the <i>arithmetization</i> of logic is also
instructive because of how <a href="#orgtarget33">it enables certain useful encodings</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
Let it be. Let it go. Let it go so. Let it be so. <a href="#orgtarget34">Make it so.</a>
</p>

<p>
Let <code>p</code> be prime. In lisp, something like <code>p</code> is called a symbol,
and you can treat a symbol essentially like a variable, although
it is <a href="#orgtarget35">much more than that</a>.
</p>

<p>
Let something be something is a very mathy way of speaking. So lisp
allows somethings to be other somethings by way of the keyword
<code>let</code>.
</p>

<p>
Like God, who said let there be light, and there was light, the
programmer commands and is obeyed. The keyword <code>let</code> binds symbols
to values, fairly commanding them to stand in for values. Values
evaluate to themselves. Symbols evaluate to the values they are
bound to. An unbound symbol cannot be evaluated. <a href="#orgtarget36">If you try it, an
error results</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before doing some exercises, let's look at <code>let</code> syntactically and
abstractly:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #268bd2;">(</span><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">let</span> &lt;frame&gt; &lt;body&gt;<span style="color: #268bd2;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> piece is a model in the form of a list of bindings.
Just as we modeled truth-value assignments as, e.g., <code>p</code> is <code>true</code>
and <code>q</code> is <code>false</code>, in list-of-bindings form this would be <code>((p
    true) (q false))</code>. A binding is a two-element list <code>(&lt;var&gt;
    &lt;val&gt;)</code>. Variables can be left unbound, so for example, <code>(let
    ((a 1) (b 2) c) ...)</code> is perfectly acceptable. It assumes <b>c</b> will
get a value later, in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is a list of forms to be evaluated &#x2014; forms that use
the bindings established in the frame model.
</p>

<p>
The frame list can be empty, as in:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #268bd2;">(</span><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">let</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">()</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">1</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">2</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">3</span><span style="color: #268bd2;">)</span>
<span style="color: #008787; background-color: #262626;">; </span><span style="color: #008787; background-color: #262626;">alternatively</span>
<span style="color: #268bd2;">(</span><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">let</span> nil <span style="color: #d75fd7;">1</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">2</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">3</span><span style="color: #268bd2;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The value of this <b>symbolic expression</b> (lispers shorten this to
an <b>s-expression</b>, or <b>sexp</b> for shorter) is 3, the value of the
last form before the closing parenthesis.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-4">
<p>
The rule for dealing with lisp expressions is to look for lists,
and when found, evaluate them. Casual observation reveals the bulk
of lisp code is in fact lists, and lists of lists nested to many
levels. Evaluating a list entails evaluating each of its elements,
except the first, which is treated differently. For now, think of
the first element as an operator that operates on the values of
the rest of the elements.  So <code>(+ 1 2 3 4)</code> adds together 1 (the
value of 1 &#x2014; <a href="#orgtarget37">numbers self-evaluate</a>), 2, 3 and 4 to
produce 10. Note the economy of this <i>prefix</i> notation, as it's
called: only one mention of the '+' sign is needed. The more
familiar <i>infix</i> notation requires redundant '+' signs, as in
<code>1+2+3+4</code>.

Til has assigned a LOT of homework. Ila complains to Abu about
it. Abu is sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
"I mostly get the logical connectives, which why we don't just call
them operators is what I don't get. They're the same as the logical
operators in JavaScript, and &#x2026;" Abu interrupted Ila's
rant. "What's JavaScript?", he asked. "It's a programming language
&#x2014; the one I mostly program in. Anyway, what I also don't get is
the conditional operator. It just seems illogical that it's defined
the way it is. How did Til put it?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe he said 'p only if q is true, except when p is more true
than q'," said Abu.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I'm talking about, what does 'more true than' mean?
Something is either true or it's not. How can it be 'more true'?
Truer than true??"
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's how I see it," said Abu. "When they have the same
truth value, both true or both false, neither is more or less than
the other, they're equal."
</p>

<p>
Ila felt her face go red. "Oh, now I get it &#x2014; a true p is greater
than a false q. And the last case, when p is false and q is true, p
is less true than q. Way less, because it has zero truth."
</p>

<p>
"Irrelevant to the truth of q," said Abu. "I drew its truth table,
like Til asked, and only one row is false, the rest true. Perhaps
you drew it this way too?"
</p>

<p>
Ila frowned. "Mine has the last column centered under the arrow,
but otherwise it's the same as yours."
</p>

<p>
"I like centered better," said Abu. "Til will be glad we get it, I
think, but do you think he was going to explain it some more?"
</p>

<p>
"He will if we ask, but I don't want to ask him &#x2014; will you?" said
Ila. "No problem," said Abu. "I don't mind appearing ignorant,
because appearances aren't deceiving in my case &#x2014; I really AM
ignorant!"  "Well, I hate asking dumb questions," said Ila. "Never
been a problem for me," said Abu with a slow exhalation.
</p>

<p>
Ila voiced her other main complaint. "And I'm still floored that he
said, go learn lisp, it will do you good." Abu nodded. "I agree
that seems like a lot to ask, but I'm enjoying the challenge. Lisp
is cool!" Ila sighed. "It certainly lives up to its name: Lots of
Irritatingly Silly Parentheses, and if you ask me, it's just
confusing." Abu smiled. "I found this <a href="#orgtarget39">xkcd comic that compares lisp</a>
to a Jedi's lightsaber. See, I <i>got</i> the Star Wars reference. And
by the way, just to show you what planet I'm from, I went and
watched Aladdin. So let's see, Chewbacca is Abu to Han Solo's
Aladdin, right!" "Hardly," said Ila. "So you saw the movie and you
still want us to call you Abu?!"
</p>

<p>
-~-~-~-~-~-
</p>

<p>
"Think of it this way," said Til. "Inside versus Outside.
<a href="#orgtarget40">With your pads</a> draw a couple of circles, two different
sizes, the smaller inside the larger. Make them concentric. Okay?
Now consider the possibilities. Can something be inside both
circles simultaneously?"
</p>

<p>
Abu and Ila nodded simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"That's your p-and-q-both-true case. Now, can something be outside
both circles? Yes, obviously. That's your p-and-q-both-false
case. And can something be inside the outer circle without being
inside the inner one? Yes, and that's when p is false and q is
true."
</p>

<p>
Ila was feeling a tingle go up her spine. She blurted, "I see it!
The only impossibility is having something inside the inner circle
but not inside the outer &#x2014; p true and q false. Makes perfect
sense!"
</p>

<p>
Til beamed. "You got it, Ila! How about you, Abu?"
</p>

<p>
Abu just smiled and nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Would you please explain 'let' more?" said Ila. She was getting
past her reluctance to ask questions, and it felt great!
</p>

<p>
"Think cars," said Til. "A car has a body built on a frame, just
like a let has a body built on a frame. But without an engine and a
driver, a car just sits there taking up space. The lisp interpreter
is like the engine, and you, the programmer, are the driver."
</p>

<p>
Abu had a thought. "A computer also has an engine and a driver,
like processor and programmer, again. But cars <i>contain</i> computers,
so I doubt <i>equating</i> a car with a computer makes sense."
</p>

<p>
Til agreed. "You see a similarity but also a big difference in the
two. A car is driven, but the only thing that results is moving
physical objects (including people) from here to there. That's all
it does, that's what it's designed to do. But a computer is
designed to do whatever the programmer can tell it to do, subject
to the constraints of its design, which still &#x2014; the space of
possibilities is huge."
</p>

<p>
Ila was puzzled. "Excuse me, but what does this have to do with
'let'?"
</p>

<p>
Til coughed. "Well, you're right, we seem to be letting the analogy
run wild. Running around inside a computer are electrons, doing the
"work" of computation, electromagnetic forces controlling things
just so. It's still electromagnetics with a car, for example,
combustion of fuel. But these electromagnetic forces are combined
with mechanical forces to make the car go."
</p>

<p>
"Just think of 'let' as initiating a computational process, with
forces defined by the lisp language and interacting via the lisp
REPL with the outside world. Then <i>letting</i> computers be like cars
makes more sense. Do you recall that a lisp program is just a
list?"
</p>

<p>
Abu nodded, but interjected. "It's really a list missing its
outermost parentheses, right?"
</p>

<p>
Til's glint was piercing. "Ah, but there's an <i>implied</i> pair of
outermost parentheses!"
</p>

<p>
Ila fairly stumbled over her tongue trying to blurt out. "And a
'let nil' form!"
</p>

<p>
Now it was Abu's turn to be puzzled. He said, "Wait, why nil?" Ila
rushed on, "It just means that your program can be self-contained,
with <b>nil</b> extra environment necessary to run. Just let it go, let
it run!"

Let's leave 'let' for now, and look at lisp functions via the
<i>defun</i> special form.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #268bd2;">(</span><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7; font-weight: bold;">&lt;parameter-list&gt;</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">[</span>optional documentation string<span style="color: #d75fd7;">]</span> &lt;body&gt;<span style="color: #268bd2;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Examples of /def/ining /fun/ctions via <code>defun</code> are
forthcoming. First note that this language feature is convenient,
but not strictly necessary, because any function definition and
call can be replaced with a <code>let</code> form, where the frame bindings
are from the <i>caller's</i> environment.
</p>

<p>
For example, the function <code>list-some-computations-on</code>, defined and
invoked (another way to say called) like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #268bd2;">(</span><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7; font-weight: bold;">list-some-computations-on</span> <span style="color: #d75fd7;">(</span>a b c d<span style="color: #d75fd7;">)</span>
  <span style="color: #008787;">"We've seen this one before."</span>
  <span style="color: #d75fd7;">(</span>list <span style="color: #2aa198;">(</span>+ a b<span style="color: #2aa198;">)</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">(</span>/ d b<span style="color: #2aa198;">)</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">(</span>- d a<span style="color: #2aa198;">)</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">(</span>* c d<span style="color: #2aa198;">)</span><span style="color: #d75fd7;">)</span><span style="color: #268bd2;">)</span>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This definition/call has exactly the same effect as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

Of course, any procedural (or object-oriented) programmer knows why
the first way is preferable. Imagine the redundant code that would
result from this sequence of calls if expanded as above:

Functions encapsulate code modules (pieces). Encapsulation enables
modularization. The modules we define as functions become part of
our vocabulary, and a new module is like a new word we can use
instead of saying what is meant by that word (i.e., its definition)
all the time.
</p>

<p>
But stripped down to its core, a <b>function</b> is just an object that
takes objects and gives other objects. Speaking completely
generally, these are objects in the 'thing' sense of the word, not
instances of classes as might be assumed if object-oriented
programming were the context. Are there <a href="#orgtarget41">any restrictions on what objects</a>
can be the inputs to a function (what it takes) and what objects
can be the outputs of a function (what it gives)? Think about and
answer this question before looking at the endnote.
</p>

<p>
VTO: again, a <b>function</b> is simply an object, a machine if you
will, that produces outputs for inputs. But simply amazingly, there
is a plethora of terms describing various kinds and attributes of
functions that have been designed and pressed into mathematical and
computer scientific service over the years:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>domain</b> is the term for the <b>set</b> of all <i>possible</i> inputs for
a <b>function</b>. (So functions depend on sets for their complete
and rigorous definitions.)</li>
<li><b>codomain</b> is the set of all <i>possible</i> outputs for a function.</li>
<li><b>range</b> is the set of all <i>actual</i> outputs for a function (may
be different &#x2014; smaller &#x2014; than the codomain).</li>
<li><b>onto</b> describes a function whose range is the same as its
codomain (that is, an <b>onto</b> function produces (for the right
inputs) all possible outputs).</li>
<li><b>surjective</b> is a synonym for onto.</li>
<li><b>surjection</b> is a noun naming a surjective function.</li>
<li><b>one-to-one</b> describes a function each of whose outputs is
generated by only one input.</li>
<li><b>injective</b> is a synonym for one-to-one.</li>
<li><b>injection</b> is a noun naming an injective function.</li>
<li><b>bijective</b> describes a function that is both one-to-one and
onto.</li>
<li><b>bijection</b> is a noun naming a bijective function.</li>
<li><b>recursive</b> describes a function that calls itself. Yes, you
read that right.</li>
<li><b>arguments</b> are the inputs to a function (argument "vector"
(argv)).</li>
<li><b>arity</b> is short for the number of input arguments a function
has (argument "count" (argc)).</li>
<li><b>k-ary function</b> &#x2014; a function with <b>k</b> inputs.</li>
<li><b>unary &#x2013; binary &#x2013; ternary</b> &#x2014; functions with 1, 2 or 3
arguments, respectively.</li>
<li><b>infix notation</b> describes a <i>binary</i> function that is marked as
a symbol <i>between</i> its two arguments (rather than before).</li>
<li><b>prefix notation</b> describes a <i>k-ary</i> function that is marked as
a symbol (such as a word (like list)) <i>before</i> its arguments,
frequently having parentheses surrounding the arguments, but
sometimes (like in lisp) having parentheses surrounding symbol
AND arguments.</li>
<li><b>postfix notation</b> describes a function that is marked as a
symbol <i>after</i> its arguments. Way less common.</li>
<li><b>image</b> describes the output of a function applied to some input
(called the <b>pre-image</b> of the output). (The image of 2 under
the 'square' function is 4. The square function's pre-image of 4
is 2.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since the square function (a unary, or arity 1 function) is a handy
one to have around, we defun it next:

As written, all of these one-liner functions are problematic;
take, for example, <code>not-with-0-1</code>. Its domain is exactly the set
<code>[0 1]</code>, and exactly that set is its codomain (and range) too. Or
that's what they <i>should</i> be. Restricting callers of this function
to only pass <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> is a <a href="#orgtarget42">non-trivial task</a>, but the
function itself can help by testing its argument and balking if
given something besides <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. Balking can mean many things
&#x2014; throwing an exception being the most extreme.

We've been viewing a function a certain way, mostly with a
programming bias, but keep in mind that functions can be viewed in
many other ways as well. The fact that functions have multiple
representations is a consequence of how useful each representation
has proven to be in its own sphere and element. A function is
representable by each of the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>assignment</li>
<li>association</li>
<li>mapping (or map)</li>
<li>machine</li>

Let's now define a <b>sequence</b> and distinguish it from a <b>set</b>. The
difference is that a sequence is an <b>ordered</b> collection. So a list
or a vector is just a sequence, and truth be told, a sequence is
really just a special kind of function.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a finite <b>sequence</b> of elements of a set <b>S</b> is a function
from the set <code>{1, 2, 3, ..., n}</code> to <b>S</b> &#x2014; the number <b>n</b> is the
<b>length</b> of the string. Alternatively, the domain of the sequence
function can be <code>{0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1}</code> (or with <code>n</code> concretized as
10, <code>[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]</code> in lisp vector style). The sequence
length is still <b>n</b> (ten) in this case.
</p>

<p>
Generically, <b>a<sub>n</sub></b> denotes the image of the (nonnegative) integer
<b>n</b>, AKA the <b>n<sup>th</sup></b> term of the sequence. An <i>infinite</i> sequence
of elements of <b>S</b> is a function from {1, 2, 3, &#x2026;} to
<b>S</b>. Shorthand notation for the entire sequence is <b>{a<sub>n</sub>}</b>. Again,
the domain can be either <b>Z<sup>+</sup></b> or <b>N</b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, <b>{a<sub>n</sub>}</b>, where each term <b>a<sub>n</sub></b> is just three times <b>n</b>
(i.e., <b>a(n) = 3n</b>, or in lisp, <code>(defun a (n) (times-3 n))</code>), is a
sequence whose list of terms (generically <b>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>,
&#x2026;</b>) would be 3, 6, 9, 12, &#x2026; (all the multiples of three &#x2014;
infinite in number).
</p>

<p>
Another term for a <i>finite</i> <b>sequence</b> is a <b>string</b>, that
venerable and versatile data structure available in almost all
programming languages. Strings are always finite &#x2014; if it's an
infinite sequence, it is most <i>emphatically</i> not a string.
</p>

<p>
With lisp symbols there must automatically be support for strings.
Every symbol has a unique string naming it, and everywhere the same
symbol is used, the same string name (retrieved via the function
<code>symbol-name</code>) comes attached.

Functions that return false (<code>nil</code>) or true (<code>t</code> &#x2014; actually
anything that evaluates to <b>non</b> <code>nil</code>) are ubiquitous. So much so
that <a href="#orgtarget43">they have a special name</a> &#x2014; <b>predicate</b>.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a <b>predicate</b> is a function whose codomain is the set <code>[true
    false]</code>, and is AKA a <b>property</b>. The domain of a predicate can be
any conceivable set. We could also call these functions <b>deciders</b>
(short for <i>decision-makers</i>) that ascertain whether or not a given
object has a specified property.

"Applying the plus function to sequences yields summations." Let's

that function's symbol, the sequence as a list, and the function

Continuing to mind our <code>p</code>'s and <code>q</code>'s, it's time to talk
predicates and quantifiers.
</p>

<p>
In our neverending quest for succinctness, we desire a shorter way
to say, for example, all the colors of the rainbow are
beautiful. Shorter, that is, than just listing all true
propositions, with <code>B</code> for Beautiful as predicate:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>B(red)</code></li>
<li><code>B(orange)</code></li>
<li><code>B(yellow)</code></li>
<li><code>B(green)</code></li>
<li><code>B(blue)</code></li>
<li><code>B(indigo)</code></li>
<li><code>B(violet)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
We know all the colors in the domain, so why not just say, for all
the colors in the rainbow, each is beautiful. Or even more
succinctly, every rainbow color is beautiful. These <i>quantifiers</i>
"all" and "every" apply to the whole of our universe of discourse.
</p>

<p>
VTO: a <b>universe of discourse</b> (AKA <b>domain of discourse</b>) is the
set of all things we've set forth to talk about, i.e., <i>all things
under consideration</i>. It must be specified (unless the real
universe is the universe of discourse) to make sense of
propositions involving predicates.  The <b>universal quantifier</b>
&forall; says something is true for all members of this universal
set, no exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Saying something like
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&forall; <code>x B(x)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
rather than
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>B(red)</code> &and; <code>B(orange)</code> &and; <code>B(yellow)</code> &and; <code>B(green)</code>
      &and; <code>B(blue)</code> &and; <code>B(indigo)</code> &and; <code>B(violet)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
(because, of course, each and every one is true) is much shorter, which is
especially important when the domain is large (or infinite).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&forall; <code>x Even(x)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
is true when <code>x</code> comes from <code>[2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26
    28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42]</code>, but false when the domain is <code>[2 4 6 8
    10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 41]</code>, instead. And
indeed
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&forall; <code>x Even(x)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
is infinitely shorter than a conjunction of unquantified
propositions <code>Even(2)</code> &and; <code>Even(4)</code> &and; &#x2026;, one for each
member of the set of even integers.

Another easy example:
</p>

<p>
Let P = "is a ball".
</p>

<p>
So P(x) means <b>x</b> is a ball. Is P(x) true?
</p>

<p>
We can't say. A predicate (or more precisely, a propositional
function (or formula) consisting of a predicate and some
variable(s)) is <b>not</b> a proposition.
</p>

<p>
&exist; x P(x)
</p>

<p>
Meaning: There exists an <b>x</b> such that <b>x</b> is a ball.
</p>

<p>
&exist; is the <b>Existential</b> quantifier.
</p>

<p>
Is this true?
</p>

<p>
It depends.
</p>

<p>
What is the Universe of Discourse?
</p>

<p>
Let it be the set [markers erasers whiteboards] (in a classroom,
for example).
</p>

<p>
&not; &exist; x P(x) means "There does not exist an <b>x</b> such that
<b>x</b> is a ball".
</p>

<p>
(True, in this Universe.)
</p>

<p>
&exist; x &not; P(x) means "There exists an <b>x</b> such that <b>x</b> is
not a ball".
</p>

<p>
This is the same as saying "Something is not a ball."
</p>

<p>
But it's not the same as saying "Everything is not a ball."
</p>

<p>
&forall; x &not; P(x)
</p>

<p>
Meaning: For every <b>x</b>, it is not the case that <b>x</b> is a ball.
</p>

<p>
Remember, &forall; is the <b>Universal</b> quantifier.
</p>

<p>
&not; &forall; x P(x) means "Not everything is a ball".
</p>

<p>
Let R(y) = "y is red".
</p>

<p>
&forall; y R(y) means "Everything is red".
</p>

<p>
&not; &forall; y R(y) means "Not everything is red".
</p>

<p>
&exist; y &not; R(y) means "There is some non-red thing."

The Gospel as Domain of Discourse is an abundantly fruitful

<p>
In his teachings, Paul the apostle uses conditionals (and their
variations) and syllogistic reasoning <b>a lot</b>. For example: I
Corinthians 15:29
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All things that are done by people are done for a reason (i.e.,
they have a point). Baptisms for the dead are done by people.
Therefore, baptisms for the dead have a point. If the dead rise
not (i.e., there is no resurrection) then there would be no point
to do baptisms for them. Thus, if baptisms for the dead have a
point, then there is a resurrection of the dead. Therefore, the
resurrection of the dead is real.

&exist; x L(x) says "some cats like liver."

There are two important concepts to keep in mind when dealing with
predicates and quantifiers.  To turn a first-order logic formula
into a proposition, variables must be <b>bound</b> either by
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>assigning them a value, or</li>
<li>quantifying them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What means Freedom Versus Bondage?
</p>

<p>
In formulas, variables can be <i>free</i> or <i>bound</i>. Bondage means
being under the control of a particular quantifier. If &phi; is
some Boolean formula and <i>x</i> is a variable in &phi;, then in both
&forall; <i>x</i> (&phi;) and &exist; <i>x</i> (&phi;) the variable <i>x</i> is
<i>bound</i> &#x2014; <i>free</i> describes a variable in &phi; that is not so
quantified.
</p>

<p>
As in propositional logic (AKA the <i>propositional</i> (or
<i>predicate</i>) <i>calculus</i>), some predicate formulas are true, others
false. It really depends on how its predicates and functions are
interpreted. But if a formula has any free variables, in general
its truth is indeterminable under <i>any</i> interpretation.
</p>

<p>
For example, let the symbol 'L' be interpreted as <i>less-than</i>.
Whether the formula
</p>

<p>
&forall; x L(x, y)
</p>

<p>
is true or not is indeterminable. But inserting an &exist; <i>y</i>
right after the &forall; <i>x</i> makes it true. Yes, we just nested
one quantifier inside another. And importantly, when nesting
<i>different-flavored</i> quantifiers, the order in which they appear
matters (but not if they are the same flavor).
</p>

<p>
Using a predicate, e.g., if (Q x y) is "x + y = x - y"
</p>

<p>
&forall; x &forall; y (Q x y) is false;
</p>

<p>
&forall; x &exist; y (Q x y) is true;
</p>

<p>
&exist; x &forall; y (Q x y) is false; and
</p>

<p>
&exist; x &exist; y (Q x y) is true.

"I hate that there are so many different ways to say the same
thing," said Ila, her complainer imp feeling especially strong
today.
</p>

<p>
Abu said, "I know what you mean. But I can see having more than one
representation enhancing my understanding. Just as Feynman's
knowledge of chemistry and physics enhanced his understanding and
appreciation of flowers, so my puny discrete mathematical mind is
enriched, not impoverished, by having more ways of seeing. I really
am starting to see the beauty of it. The more representations, the
clearer our understanding."
</p>

<p>
Ila replied, "Maybe, but I'm not convinced yet. Til, you no doubt
agree with Abu, right?"
</p>

<p>
Til cautioned, "Yes, but we must be careful. Each representation
has its own precision &#x2026; and its own vagueness."
</p>

<p>
"How so?" asked Abu.
</p>

<p>
"We use words, symbols, pictures, etc., to understand our world and
achieve mutual understanding amongst ourselves," said Til. "But
each representation of an idea we seek to illuminate is just a
facet of the whole, and subject to misinterpretation if solely
focused on. We need to be holistic AND reductionistic, both &#x2014; not
one at the exclusion of the other."
</p>

<p>
Abu and Ila both looked mildly puzzled, but Til went on. "Look at
how we write 1/2 versus &frac12; or \(\frac{1}{2}\). The first
suggests one divided by two, the second or third the fraction
one-half, what we get when we divide one by two. The process versus
the result. Neither is more important than the other."
</p>

<p>
"Representational space deals with relations between ideas,
concepts, aspects of reality. Representational fluency speaks to
how nimbly we deal with aspects of reality like time and space, and
our movement through each. Causality, cause and effect &#x2014;
three-dimensional spatial relationships, above, below, right, left,
before or behind &#x2014; proximity and locality, are you with me here?"
said Til. He had noticed Ila starting to drift, although Abu was
still focused.
</p>

<p>
Ila replied, "Yes, sorry. Could you explain more what you meant by,
if there's any such thing as a <i>central</i> idea in math,
representational fluency is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's central," said Til, "because it's <i>key</i> to a mathematician's
success. The successful ones work for and attain the ability to
move fluently among various referent representations, while
allowing a given representation to stand for different referents
depending on the context. Especially when referring to functions,
it's crucial to be able to move comfortably between equations,
tables, graphs, verbal descriptions, etc."

"Speaking of graphs," said Abu, "this picture you're showing us is
what I've thought were graphs ever since I took algebra."

<p>
"Ila, do you agree this is the everyday ordinary meaning of
<i>graphs</i>?" asked Til.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, except I know they're also these webby-looking things with
dots and lines," said Ila. "Just another example of confusing
terminology, this time using the same word to refer to two
different things."
</p>

<p>
"Right, and we'll get to those types of graphs, important discrete
structures as they are, later," said Til, ignoring her
complaint. "But for now, here's what I want you to do. I've just
sent to your pads a high-level summary of how mathematicians from
Euclid (at least) on down work at the task of understanding. Take
this list and find examples in math history of each step:"

<li>Decide that an important measure of understanding is easy, fluid
translation (movement) between representations.</li>
<li>Make in-the-large pattern recognition easier because of fluency

meaningful patterns. Novices see little, not so meaningful
patterns.)</li>
<li>Gain expertise by lots of problem solving practice.</li>
<li>Evolve representations via problem solving practice.</li>

How have mathematicians generalized functions? They defined
<i>relations</i>. With one big difference, relations are essentially
functions. The difference is, there is no "fan-out" constraint on
relations as there is on functions. What that means is that an
element of the domain of a relation can map to <i>any number</i> of
(zero, one or more) elements in its codomain.
</p>

<p>
VTO: A <i>binary relation</i> <b>R</b> from a set <b>A</b> to a set <b>B</b> is a
subset: <b>R</b> &sube; <b>A</b> &times; <b>B</b>. A binary relation <b>R</b> <i>on a
set</i> <b>A</b> (a <b>self relation</b>) is a subset of <b>A</b> &times; <b>A</b>, or a
relation from <b>A</b> to <b>A</b> (from the set to itself).
</p>

<p>
VTO: <b>A</b> &times; <b>B</b>, the <b>Cartesian product</b> (or just product) of
set <b>A</b> with set <b>B</b> is the set of all ordered pairs <b>(a b)</b>
where <b>a</b> &isin; <b>A</b> and <b>b</b> &isin; <b>B</b>. This generalizes to <b>n</b> sets in
the obvious way.
</p>

<p>
For an <b>A</b> &times; <b>B</b> example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A</b> = [a b c]</li>
<li><b>B</b> = [1 2 3]</li>
<li><b>R</b> = [(a 1) (a 2) (b 2) (b 3) (c 3)]</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a self relation example:

To end this foray into all things relational, it is illuminating
to investigate <a href="#orgtarget45">how mathematicians think</a> and make sense of the
world. However, this investigation will be limited for now to one
mathematician in particular &#x2014; Roger Penrose.
</p>

<p>
So this is how one world-class mathematician (who is also a
mathematical physicist) thinks. In this excerpt from his book <i>The
Large, the Small and the Human Mind</i>, with abundant intellectual
humility, Penrose writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What is <i>consciousness</i>?
</p>

<p>
Well, I don't know how to define it.
</p>

<p>
I think this is not the moment to attempt to define consciousness,
since we do not know what it is. I believe that it is a physically
accessible concept; yet, to define it would probably be to define
the wrong thing. I am, however, going to describe it, to some
degree. It seems to me that there are at least two different
aspects to consciousness. On the one hand, there are <i>passive</i>
manifestations of consciousness, which involve <i>awareness</i>. I use
this category to include things like perceptions of colour, of
harmonies, the use of memory, and so on. On the other hand, there
are its <i>active</i> manifestations, which involve concepts like free
will and the carrying out of actions under our free will. The use
of such terms reflects different aspects of our consciousness.
</p>

<p>
I shall concentrate here mainly on something else which involves
consciousness in an essential way. It is different from both
passive and active aspects of consciousness, and perhaps is
something somewhere in between. I refer to the use of the term
<i>understanding</i>, or perhaps <i>insight</i>, which is often a better
word. I am not going to define these terms either &#x2014; I don't know
what they mean. There are two other words I do not understand &#x2014;
<i>awareness</i> and <i>intelligence</i>. Well, why am I talking about
things when I do not know what they really mean? It is probably
because I am a mathematician and mathematicians do not mind so
much about that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
They do not need precise definitions of the things they are
talking about, provided they can say something about the
<i>connections</i> between them.
</p>

<p>
The first key point here is that it seems to me that intelligence
is something which requires understanding. To use the term
intelligence in a context in which we deny that any understanding
is present seems to me to be unreasonable. Likewise, understanding
without any awareness is also a bit of nonsense. Understanding
requires some sort of awareness. That is the second key point. So,
that means that intelligence requires awareness. Although I am not
defining any of these terms, it seems to me to be reasonable to
insist upon these relations between them.

"So, what is the connection between probability and counting?" asked
Til. Ila stared with wonder and amazement. It was like Til had no
problem whatsoever dispensing with the normal pleasantries of
conversation. Like that time when she arrived a few minutes before
Abu and tried to make small talk with Til. "So, it seems that you're
interested in stars!" she had said. "Yes, I am." Til had replied,
and then got that faraway look in his eyes, like he was suddenly out
there among the stars, abruptly leaving the nearby flesh-and-blood
human behind.
</p>

<p>
Like he had that time by arriving with a cheery greeting, Abu broke
the awkward silence this time by cautiously saying "Well, I think it
has to do with counting the number of ways something can happen and
then confirming that count by experimenting, like flipping a coin or
rolling dice."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so you're a frequentist!" said Til. Abu blinked and then
quickly nodded, alert to the agitation he sensed well up in
Ila. "Wait, what's a frequentist? said Ila. "As opposed to a
<i>subjectivist</i>, whose view of probability is different," said Til.
</p>

<p>
"Let me compare and contrast these two schools of thought," said
Til, after a brief pause while he gathered his thoughts and Abu and
Ila sat lost in theirs. "To a frequentist, probability is counting
the number of times something actually happens, like landing heads
to use Abu's coin flipping experiment, and comparing that frequency
with the number of flips. The 'landing heads' when flipping a coin
is called an event, the 'landing-either-heads-or-tails (but not
neither and certainly not both)' is called the space of
possibilities, or the probability space of this experiment. In other
words, the probability space is all possible outcomes, and the event
is a subset of that space. The frequentist holds that the frequency
of actual outcomes, counting say 51 heads in 100 coin tosses, is an
approximation to the exact probability of getting heads on any
single toss of a coin."
</p>

<p>
"So, if I understand this right," said Ila, "I can say the
probability of getting heads is 51/100, or 498/1000 or whatever it
is after repeating the experiment however many times I want." "Yes,
if you're a frequentist!" said Til. "But I really just want to say
it's 50%, or a 50-50 chance, because of how coins have two sides,
and unless there's something funny about my quarter here, tossing it
gives no preference to one side or the other. So either is equally
likely, right?" "So right, if you're a <i>thought-experiment</i>
frequentist!" said Til.
</p>

<p>
"But aren't there fake coins that are biased to land more often
heads than tails, or vice-versa?" said Abu.  "Yes, but what's your
point?"  said Til. "Well, if I did the experiment of tossing some
such biased coin a thousand times, and counted 600 heads," said Abu,
"I'd be more inclined to suspect the coin was <i>unfair</i> than to think
the likelihood of getting heads was 60%." "That's because you have a
high degree of belief, a subjective intuition if you will, about how
coins <i>should</i> behave." said Til.
</p>

<p>
"Is that what a subjectivist is, someone who treats probability as a
subjective belief in how likely something is?" said Ila. "Exactly
right!" said Til. "Obviously, frequentism cannot work in all cases,
because some 'experiments' can't be done, or if not outright
impossible, can't be repeated, or even tried once without disastrous
results." Abu chimed in, "Like what's the probability that the world
will end and humanity extinguish itself in a nuclear holocaust?  I
may think it's not very likely, but someone else might disagree and
think the probability is high."
</p>

<p>
"I've got one!" said Ila. "What's the probability that our sun will
go supernova tomorrow?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd give that one a 0% chance, personally," said Abu. "Same here,"
said Til. "But that's just our belief &#x2014; mixed of course with
scientific knowledge about how stars live and die. When people use
pseudoscience to predict the future, or substitute opinion for fact,
and 'estimate' probabilities to further some hidden agenda &#x2014;
that's when math abuse, and truth abuse abound."
</p>

<p>
"Truth abuse sounds worse than math abuse," said Ila. "Truth is,"
replied Til, "popular culture conspires to disguise truth, and
substitute illusion for what's real. For example, take the famous
Mr. Spock from Star Trek. In the original series, Spock was always
telling Captain Kirk 'I estimate our chances (of getting out of
such-and-such predicament) to be 0.02794%' or some such ridiculously
small and precise number. And viewers accepted this ludicrous
scenario without question because Hollywood had convinced them
Mr. Spock was this logical, mathematical, scientific <b>paragon</b>."
</p>

<p>
Again, Abu and Ila paused to consider the implications of what Til
had just said. Ila had a thought. "Til, are you a frequentist or a
subjectivist?" she asked.  "Both!" said Til, with a mischievous
smile. Then while softly clearing his throat he subvocalized the
contradictory addendum, "And neither."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate," continued Til, full voice, "if we're going to learn
how to count today we'd better get to it!"

Counting involves applying logic and some general principles to
find the number of ways some choice can be made, some task can be
done, or some event can happen. Counting ways of combining
abstract or concrete objects from given sets they belong to is the
goal.
</p>

<p>
VTO:
</p>

<p>
The <b>Addition Principle</b> (AKA the <b>Sum Rule</b>): faced with a task
to select just one member from each set in a collection of two or
more sets, the <i>number of ways</i> to make the selection is the sum
of the sizes of the sets, <i>provided</i> the sets have no members in
common.
</p>

<p>
Example: The number of ways to choose one vowel <b>or</b> one consonant
from the alphabet is 5 + 21 = 26. It should not be surprising that
this is the same as the number of ways to choose <i>one letter</i> from
the whole alphabet. The Addition Principle involves an <b>either-or</b>
choice, where the choices are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
VTO:
</p>

<p>
The <b>Multiplication Principle</b> (AKA the <b>Product Rule</b>): faced
with a task to select one member from one set, <b>and</b> one member
from another set, <b>and</b> (continue with arbitrarily many sets) &#x2026;,
the <i>number of ways</i> to do so is the product of the sizes of the
sets.  Here again it is usually stipulated that the sets are
disjoint &#x2014; meaning they have no members in common.
</p>

<p>
Example: The number of ways to choose one vowel <b>and</b> one
consonant from the alphabet is \(5 \cdot 21 = 105\). The
Multiplication Principle involves a <b>both-and</b> choice.
</p>

<p>
In sum, adding is like or-ing, and multiplying is like and-ing, to
liken '+' to &or; and '*' to &and;.
</p>

<p>
Mixing these two principles in certain ways leads to basic
counting techniques applicable to many many counting tasks. The
hard part of the solution to any counting problem is <i>choosing</i>
the appropriate model and technique. After that, <i>applying</i> the
appropriate technique (formula) is easy.
</p>

<p>
VTO:
</p>

<p>
A <b>permutation</b> is an arrangement, where <i>order matters</i> (just
like with nested quantifiers).  
</p>

<p>
A <b>combination</b> is a subset, where <i>order matters not</i>, like with
sets in general.
</p>

<p>
So whether order matters or not is one dimension of a counting
problem, with another dimension being whether or not repetition of
elements is allowed. Generally speaking these considerations are
germane to either permutations or combinations, but there are
subtle variations of permunations and combitations to take into
account as well.
</p>

<p>
To wit, given a set of <i>n</i> objects, say you want to select <i>r</i> of
them. After choosing one object from the set &#x2014;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you can either put it back &#x2014; called <i>selection with
replacement</i> (or allowing repetition)</li>
<li>or not &#x2014; called <i>selection without replacement</i> (or
disallowing repetition)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Choosing the appropriate technique requires answering the two
questions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Does the order of the selected objects matter or not?</li>
<li>Is the selection with or without replacement (repetition)?</li>
</ol>

<p>
In general, how many different possible sequences (arrangements)
of objects there are depends on the size (length) of the
sequence. Selection without replacement of <i>r</i> objects from a set
of <i>n</i> objects naturally constrains <i>r</i> to be at most <i>n</i>. If more
than one object is selected (\(r \ge 2\)), two different orderings
or arrangements of the objects constitute different
permutations. Thus it is:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Choose the first object <i>n</i> ways, <b>and</b></li>
<li>Choose the second object \((n - 1)\) ways (when selection is
without replacement, there is one fewer object to choose from)
<b>and</b></li>
<li>Choose the third object \((n - 2)\) ways (again without
replacement,) &#x2026;</li>
</ol>

<p>
Finally choose the \(r^{th}\) object \((n - r + 1)\) ways.
</p>

<p>
By the Multiplication Principle, the number of <i>r</i>-permutations of
<i>n</i> things, or said another way, the number of permutations of <i>n</i>
things taken <i>r</i> at a time is
</p>

<p>
\(P(n, r) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots (n - r + 1) = n!/(n - r)!\)

If selection is without replacement but order does not matter,
this is the same as selecting subsets of size <i>r</i> from a set of
size <i>n</i>. Again, \(0 \le r \le n\). The secret is to divide out
the number of arrangements or permutations of the <i>r</i> objects from
the set of permutations of <i>n</i> objects taken <i>r</i> at a time. Since
each <i>r</i>-combination can be arranged \(r!\) ways, we have \(r!\)
permutations for each <i>r</i>-combination.  So the number of
<i>r</i>-combinations of <i>n</i> things, or, the number of combinations of
<i>n</i> things taken <i>r</i> at a time is
</p>

<p>
\(C(n, r) = P(n, r)/P(r, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)! r!}\)
</p>

<p>
Example: How many ways can we choose a three-letter subset of the
nine letters ABCDELMNO?
</p>

<p>
We have selection without replacement, and because we want a
subset (not a sequence) the order does not matter &#x2014; CDE = CED =
DCE = DEC = ECD = EDC &#x2014; they're all the same. So <i>n = 9</i> and <i>r
= 3</i>:
</p>

<p>
\(C(9, 3) = \frac{9!}{(9 - 3)! 3!} = \frac{9!}{6!3!} =
    \frac{362880}{720 \cdot 6} = 84\)

<i>Basic Probability Theory</i>
</p>

<p>
Taking a frequentist position is the usual way to begin exploring
the vast <i>space</i> of BPT.
</p>

<p>
VTO: 
</p>

<p>
A <b>Probability Space</b> is a finite set of points, each of which
represents one possible outcome of an experiment. This is the
discrete definition, as opposed to the continuous one with
infinite points.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each point <i>x</i> is associated with a real number between 0 and 1
called the probability of <i>x</i>.</li>
<li>The sum of all the points' probabilities \(= 1\).</li>
<li>Given <i>n</i> points, if all are equally likely (a typical
assumption) then \(1/n\) is the probability of each point.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Example: What are the possible outcomes of throwing a single
<b>fair</b> die?
</p>

<p>
<code>[1 2 3 4 5 6]</code> is the probability space of outcomes as a lisp
vector.
</p>

<p>
VTO:
</p>

<p>
An <b>Event</b> is a <i>subset</i> of the points in a probability space.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i><b>P(E)</b></i> (or <i><b>Pr(E)</b></i>, or sometimes even <i><b>p(E)</b></i>) denotes the
probability of the event <i>E</i>.</li>
<li>If the points are equally likely, then <i>P(E)</i> is the sum of the
points in <i>E</i> divided by the sum of the points in the entire
probability space.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the (fair) die throwing example, each number 1-6 is equally
likely, so 1/6 is the probability of each number.
</p>

<p>
Example: What are the possible outcomes of flipping two <b>fair</b>
coins?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Probability Space: 4 outcomes (1/4 probability of each outcome).</li>

<li>Event: seeing a head (<code>H</code>) and a tail (<code>T</code>) &#x2014; the middle two
of the four possibilities:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>HH</code></li>
<li><code>HT</code></li>
<li><code>TH</code></li>
<li><code>TT</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are two points in the event, so 2/4 or 1/2 is the event's
probability.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ramp Up to Four</i>
</p>

<p>
When flipping four coins is the experiment, the probability space
quadruples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Probability Space: 16 outcomes, each having 1/16 probability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Double Previous Event</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Event: seeing two heads and two tails.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>HHHH</code></li>
<li><code>HHHT</code></li>
<li><code>HHTH</code></li>
<li><code>HHTT</code></li>

<li><code>TTHH</code></li>
<li><code>TTHT</code></li>
<li><code>TTTH</code></li>
<li><code>TTTT</code></li>

With 6 points in it (can you pick them out?) 6/16 or 3/8 is the
probability of this event.

"Euclid proved there are infinitely many primes. Can you?!" Til
said. His words were met with utter silence. Dropping that
bombshell meant his two pupils had to readjust to the darkness of
uncertainty while trying to process what Til just said so
nonchalantly. Without waiting for the daze to subside, he went
on. "Before the end of today's session, you will have learned the
classic method he used to accomplish this amazing feat."
</p>

<p>
"Another way to say there are infinitely many primes is to say
there is no largest prime," said Til.  "Suppose not &#x2026;" he trailed
off, pausing for dramatic effect.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, what do you mean, suppose not?" said Ila. "I thought we were
trying to prove a negative anyway, that there is no largest prime?"
</p>

<p>
"What I mean is, suppose, in contradiction to what we seek to
establish, that there <b>is</b> a largest prime. Call it <b>x</b>."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," said Ila. "I don't see how that helps us prove that
there <b>is</b> no largest prime?"
</p>

<p>
"What we're going to do is show that it is <b>logically impossible</b>
for this <b>x</b>, this so-called largest prime to exist!" said Til.
</p>

<p>
Abu chimed in. "This sounds like some Latin phrase I read somewhere
&#x2014; I believe it's <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> &#x2014; RAA to TLA it."
</p>

<p>
Til replied, "Right As Always!" To which Ila takes umbrage. "Hey,
Abu's not <b>always</b> right. I'm right too sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"I was just kidding," said Til. "But you realize that saying Abu is
always right says nothing about how often you're right, right?"
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Ila. "It's just that he's always so smiley and
self-assured and smug. Like this stuff is a piece of cake to
him."
</p>

<p>
"Hey, it <b>is</b> a piece of cake &#x2014; and a delicious one at that!"
said Abu.
</p>

<p>
"Can we get on with the proof?" said Til. Both Ila and Abu nodded
yes, Abu still grinning &#x2014; bad enough, thought Ila, but worse
still, he winked at me as Til looked down at his pads. Grrr!
</p>

<p>
"So, <b>x</b> is the greatest prime. Now follow these seven steps," said Til.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"First form the product of all primes less than or equal to <b>x</b>,
and then add 1 to the product.</li>
<li>This yields a new number <b>y</b>. To concretize, <b>y</b> = (2 &times; 3
&times; 5 &times; 7 &times; &#x2026; &times; x) + 1.</li>
<li>If <b>y</b> is itself a prime, then <b>x</b> is not the greatest prime,
for <b>y</b> is obviously greater than <b>x</b>.</li>
<li>If <b>y</b> is composite (i.e., not a prime), then again <b>x</b> is not
the greatest prime. That's because being composite means <b>y</b>
<i>must</i> have a prime divisor <b>z</b>; and <b>z</b> must be different from
each of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, &#x2026;, up to <b>x</b>. Hence <b>z</b> must be
a prime <i>greater than</i> <b>x</b>.</li>
<li>But <b>y</b> is either prime or composite, there's no third option.</li>
<li>Hence <b>x</b> is not the greatest prime.</li>
<li>Hence there is no greatest prime."</li>
</ol>

<p>
"Whoa, back up, please!" said Ila. "I'm doing this and I don't see
where <b>y</b> is ever composite:"
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 + 1 = 3</li>
<li>2 &times; 3 + 1 = 7</li>
<li>2 &times; 3 &times; 5 + 1 = 31</li>
<li>2 &times; 3 &times; 5 &times; 7 + 1 = 211</li>
<li>2 &times; 3 &times; 5 &times; 7 &times; 11 + 1 = 2311</li>
</ul>

<p>
"All of these, 3, 7, 31, 211, 2311, &#x2026; are prime," said Ila. "Abu,
don't you agree?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, actually, look at the very next one in the sequence." said
Abu. "2 &times; 3 &times; 5 &times; 7 &times; 11 &times; 13 + 1 = 30031,
which is 59 (prime) &times; 509 (also prime), if I calculate
correctly."
</p>

<p>
Ila was completely taken aback. Why she didn't think to go one step
further caused her jaw to drop with a thud.
</p>

<p>
Noticing Ila's nonplussitude, Til reassured her. "Abu calculated
correctly, but you would have too, and the fact you stopped one
short is just another testimony to the all too human tendency to
leap to conclusions with inductive assertions."
</p>

<p>
"So, yeah, I see it now," said Ila, recovering. "That special
number <b>y</b> &#x2014; made by adding 1 to the product of all primes in a
<b>supposedly complete</b> list of primes &#x2014; always gives rise, one way
or another, to a prime not in the list!"
</p>

<p>
"You got it!" said Til. "Me too," grinned Abu. "It's a weird way to
prove something, though. It just seems backwards."
</p>

<p>
"It <b>is</b> backwards," said Til. "It's called proof by contradiction,
or reducing to the absurd, to translate your Latin phrase. It's a
wonderfully respectable, nay, even venerable, proof technique."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" said Ila. "After all, it goes all the way back to Euclid!"

Til's aside, we fire our opening salvo into <a href="#orgtarget46">"mathmagic land"</a> by
way of distinguishing Elementary Number Theory from Advanced (or
Analytic) Number Theory (ANT)). ANT uses the techniques of
calculus to analyze whole numbers, whereas ENT uses only
arithmetic and algebra. What more primordial concept to begin with
than those <a href="#orgtarget47">multiplicative building blocks</a>, the <b>atoms</b> of numbers,
primes. Let's examine several ways to say the same thing:
</p>

<p>
VTO: a <b>prime</b> is a number (integer) greater than 1 that is
divisible <i>only</i> by 1 and itself.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A prime is a positive integer &gt; 1 with exactly 2 divisors (those
being 1 and itself).</li>
<li>A positive integer &gt; 1 that is not prime is called composite.</li>
<li>In first-order logic, prime(n) &harr; &forall; x &forall;
      y [(x &gt; 1 &and; y &gt; 1) &rarr; xy &ne; n].</li>
<li>A <b>composite</b> is a positive integer with 3 or more divisors
(because 3 is the first number greater than 2, and a number
cannot have fewer than two divisors).</li>
<li><a href="#orgtarget48">1 is neither prime nor composite</a> &#x2014; call it <b>unit</b>.</li>
<li><a href="#orgtarget49">2 is the only even prime</a>: &exist; ! n [even(n) &and;
prime(n)]. The "&exist; !" construct is short for "there exists
a unique" or "there exists one and only one".</li>
</ul>

<p>
What's so important about primes?
</p>

<p>
<b>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</b>, that's what. The FTA says
that every positive integer can be written as the product of prime
numbers in essentially one way. (So, 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 3
&times; 5 &times; 7 = 840 = 7 &times; 5 &times; 3 &times; 2 &times; 2
&times; 2 is two ways in one &#x2014; the order of the factors doesn't
matter.)
</p>

<p>
Sometimes uniqueness is guaranteed by phrasing it as "every
integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as
the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are
written in order of nondecreasing size". But what about 1? The
first statement didn't exclude it, why did the second?
</p>

<p>
Determining if a given integer is prime is a <b>key</b> component to
modern cryptology &#x2014; and <b>crucial</b> to the success of the
enterprise of cryptology is the difficulty of factoring large
integers into their prime factors.
</p>

<p>
More prime lore <a href="#orgtarget50">can be perused and pursued</a> by the interested
reader, but here's a playful smattering:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What's the smallest three-digit number that remains prime no
matter how its digits are shuffled?</li>
<li>Why are the primes 2, 5, 71, 369119, and 415074643 so special?</li>
<li>Cicadas of the genus Magicada appear once every 7, 13, or 17
years; whether it's a coincidence or not that these are prime
numbers is unknown.</li>
<li>Sherk's conjecture. The <b>n<sup>th</sup></b> prime, if <b>n</b> is even, can be
represented by the addition and subtraction of 1 with all the
smaller primes. For example, 13 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 5 + 7 + 11.</li>
<li>You look up one on your own so sexy can be 6 (because the Latin
for <i>six</i> is <i>sex</i>).</li>
<li><b>Sexy primes</b> are such that <b>n</b> and <b>n</b> + 6 are both prime. The
first few such pairs are 5-11, 11-17, and 13-19.</li>

There are many more prime puzzles for our pondering pleasure
provided also courtesy David Wells. A random sample will suffice
for now.
</p>

<p>
Is there a prime between n and 2n for every integer n &gt; 1?  Yes,
provably so.
</p>

<p>
Is there a prime between n<sup>2</sup> and (n + 1)<sup>2</sup> for every n &gt; 0?  No
one knows.
</p>

<p>
Many primes are of the form n<sup>2</sup> + 1 (e.g., 2, 5, 17, 37, 101,
&#x2026;). Are there a finite or infinite number of primes of this
form? No one knows.
</p>

<p>
Is there an even number greater than 2 that is <b>not</b> the sum of
two primes? No one knows. (That there is not is Goldbach's
Conjecture.)
</p>

<p>
Is there a polynomial with integer coefficients (e.g., n<sup>2</sup> -
n + 41) that takes on only prime values at the integers? The next
exercise explores this question.

This seems to show that \(\pi(n) \approx \frac{n}{\log n}\).
</p>

<p>
More formally, \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\pi(n)}{(n\ /
    \log n)} = 1\).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The discovery of [this theorem] can be traced as far back as
Gauss, at age fifteen (around 1792), but the rigorous
mathematical proof dates from 1896 and the independent work of
C. de la Vall&eacute;e Poussin and Jacques Hadamard. Here is
order extracted from confusion, providing a moral lesson on how
individual eccentricities can exist side by side with law and
order.

<p>
So \(n\ / \log n\) is a fairly simple approximation for
\(\pi(n)\), but it is not especially close. Much closer is an
approximation that uses the renowned Riemann zeta function:
</p>

<p>
\(\zeta(z) = 1 + \frac{1}{2^z} + \frac{1}{3^z} + \frac{1}{4^z} +
     \cdots\)
</p>

<p>
\(R(n) = 1 + \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k\zeta(k + 1)}
     \frac{(\log n)^k}{k!}\)
</p>

<p>
Let's see how much better R(n) approximates &pi;(n):

There is an <b>astounding</b> proof that there exist <i>arbitrarily long</i>
sequences of <i>highly composite</i> consecutive integers! (That means
having as many prime factors as we want.) In other more precise
words:
</p>

<p>
Let r and n be positive integers. Then there exist r consecutive
numbers, each divisible by <i>at least</i> n distinct primes.
</p>

<p>
Actually, we would need a little more knowledge before looking at
the proof of this amazing (if you think about it) theorem. But as
persistent investigation will reveal, what this proof demonstrates
(like others) is that these multiplicative building blocks called
the prime numbers have a gamut of surprises.

Concepts known to ancient Greek mathematicians and no doubt before
then too, Greatest Common Divisors (GCD) and Least Common
Multiples (LCM) have an interesting interplay.
</p>

<p>
VTO: In lisp style, the Greatest Common Divisor <code>(gcd a b)</code> is the
largest integer that <i>divides</i> both <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, and its
counterpart, the Least Common Multiple <code>(lcm a b)</code>, is the
smallest positive integer that <i>is divisible by</i> both <b>a</b> and
<b>b</b>. Integers whose gcd is 1 are called <b>coprime</b> (or relatively
prime), while <b>pairwise coprime</b> (or pairwise relatively prime)
describes a set of integers every pair of which is coprime.

Modular Exponentiation: as powerful as simple as algorithms go.
</p>

<p>
Say we want to compute, for example, 893<sup>2753</sup>%4721. (Why we
would want to do that is a mystery, but let it go for now.)
</p>

<p>
Doing this the straightforward way &#x2014; raising 893 to the power
2753 and then reducing that huge number modulo 4721 &#x2014; is
difficult and slow to do by hand. An easy, fast way to do it (by
hand and even faster by computer) first expands the exponent in
base 2:
</p>

<p>
2753 = 101011000001<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>7</sup> + 2<sup>9</sup> + 2<sup>11</sup> = 1 + 64 +
128 + 512 + 2048
</p>

<p>
In this table of powers of 2 powers of 893, all instances of
&equiv; should technically be &equiv;<sub>4721</sub>, as all intermediate
values are reduced modulo 4721:

We have been investigating a modular arithmetic scenario known to
the first century Chinese and probably before that too. But the
name has stuck to them: the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In a
nutshell:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Given the remainders from dividing an integer n by an <i>arbitrary</i>
set of divisors, the remainder when n is divided by the <i>least
common multiple</i> of those divisors is <i>uniquely</i> determinable.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the divisors are pairwise coprime, their LCM is their product,
which is slightly easier to compute, which is why the CRT is
usually presented in this more restrictive form (less
arbitrary). A proof by construction is typical &#x2014; show how to
find the unique solution &#x2014; and prove the construction correct.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of this method using the system Til had Abu and
Ila solve:

So x = 4 &times; 143 &times; -2 + 2 &times; 91 &times; 4 + 9 &times; 77 &times; -1<br  />
= 4 &times; -286 + 2 &times; 364 + 9 &times; -77<br  />
= -1144 + 728 + -693<br  />
= -1109
</p>

<p>
Now add 1001 twice to get 893. Why 1001? Why twice?
</p>

<p>
Because we want TUMMI, so it must be a number between 0 and 1001
(actually 1000).

"We've been drawing trees left to right, but let's switch to the
more traditional top to bottom view," said Til. Abu smiled. "I
remember reading in that book of his you had us read, Pinker said
something about how 'botanically improbable' growing trees from the
root down is!"
</p>

<p>
"Improbable or not, let's grow some trees," Til continued. "Build
them from scratch. Construct them from cells. Not actual biological
cells, that would take too long &#x2013; we'll use memory cells.  Storage
cells in computer memory take many forms, but in lisp, a cell looks
like this"
</p>

<p>
<code>[car|cdr]</code>
</p>

<p>
"More TLAs?" said Ila. "Yes," replied Til, "but you're going to have
to find out what they mean on your own."
</p>

<p>
Not too reluctantly nodding her assent, Ila saw flashes of race cars
and compact disk readers as Til went on. "The <i>car</i> and the <i>cdr</i>
(pronounced <i>could-er</i>) go hand in hand in a memory
companionship. Think of this <i>construct</i> (abbreviated <i>cons</i>) as a
dyad &#x2014; a structure of two things. Actually, these two things are
pointers to two other things.  The things on either side can be
atoms or non-atoms (molecules)."
</p>

<p>
"So an atom is like a number or a symbol, and a molecule is like a
list or a vector?" Abu said. "Yes, or like a string?" Ila jumped in.
"Mostly yes to you, Abu; but no to you, Ila," said Til. "A string is
an atom too?" Ila sighed. Til nodded. "Is there a predicate to tell
the difference?" said Abu.  "Indeed!" said Til. "What do you suppose
its name is?!"

Cars and cdrs. Abbreviated, the <b>car</b> is a forward slash (pointing
down to the left) and the <b>cdr</b> is a backward slash (pointing down
to the right). Then a <b>cons</b> cell without 'pointees' looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/|\]
</pre>

<p>
And with pointees:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/|\]
a   b
</pre>

<p>
In lisp-speak this is a <b>dotted pair</b>, so named because its printed
representation separates car from cdr by a dot (period):
</p>

<p>
<code>(cons 'a 'b)</code> <i>evaluates to</i> <code>(a . b)</code>
</p>

<p>
A list is built with a chain of cons cells:
</p>

<p>
<code>(cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c (cons 'd nil))))</code> <i>evaluates to</i> <code>(a b c d)</code>
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/|-]--&gt;[/|-]--&gt;[/|-]--&gt;[/|_]
a       b       c       d
</pre>

<p>
A tree is built differently:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(cons (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'c 'd)) ; evaluates to ((a . b) c . d)

   [/|\]
 [/|\|/|\]
 a  b c  d
</pre>

<pre class="example">
(cons
     (cons
          (cons 'a 'b)
          (cons 'c 'd)
     )
     (cons
          (cons 'e 'f)
          (cons 'g 'h)
     )
) ; evaluates to: (((a . b) c . d) (e . f) g . h)

       [/|\]
       /   \
  [/|\]     [/|\]
  /   \     /   \
[/|\][/|\][/|\][/|\]
a  b c  d e  f g  h
</pre>

<p>
Now we know how trees look as cons cells consed together,
we can render them without the clutter of the containers:
</p>

<pre class="example">
              /\
             a  b

              /\

These growth patterns can continue to any depth, but this is enough
for now. Before proceeding, let's lay out the common nomenclature
for things <i>knobby</i> and <i>smooth</i>. (Lots of VTOs ahead, so we'll
dispense with that marker.)
</p>

<p>
A <b>node</b> is the knobby thing (drawn as a two-dimensional circle or
box), also called a <b>vertex</b> (plural <b>vertices</b>).
</p>

<p>
A <b>link</b> is the smooth thing (drawn as a one-dimensional line),
also called an <b>edge</b>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>tree</b> is a collection of nodes and links, the links connecting
nodes to other nodes such that there is <i>only one</i> <b>path</b> from one
node to any other node. If there is more than one path, it's not a
tree, it's a graph. More on which later.
</p>

<p>
A path is a sequence of links from node to node. A proper link
sequence has shared nodes between successive links. Think of a link
as an ordered pair (like a cons) of nodes. So to be a sequence, the
first node of a link must be the second node of its preceding link;
likewise, the second node of a link must be the first node of its
following link. Writing nodes as letters and links as pairs of
letters (TWO-letter-acronyms), <code>ab bc cd</code> is a valid sequence, but
<code>ab cb cd</code> is not.
</p>

<p>
A tree always has one more node than it has
links. Always. Visualize starting with a <i>seedling</i> that has only
one node (sometimes called a <b>degenerate</b> tree). This singleton
node has zero links. One is one more than zero.
</p>

<p>
Let's render a node as a star:
</p>

<pre class="example">
*
</pre>

<p>
Adding one link also adds a node at the other end. Now there are
two nodes and one link.
</p>

<pre class="example">
  *
 /
*
</pre>

<p>
Add another link (with its other-end node) to the first node and
now there are three nodes and two links:
</p>

<pre class="example">
  *
 / \
*   *
</pre>

<p>
In lisp:
</p>

<p>
<code>(cons (cons nil nil) (cons nil nil)) ; ((nil) nil)</code>
</p>

<p>
Or
</p>

<p>
<code>(cons (cons t t) (cons t t)) ; ((t . t) t . t)</code>
</p>

<p>
It seems like an obvious pattern: one cons cell for every node
(star). One cons call takes two arguments. Two (arguments) is one
more than one (cons call). So counting total calls and arguments,
there's always one more argument (nodes) than there are calls
(links).
</p>

<p>
But that's wrong! The correct way to count nodes and links is as
follows:
</p>

<p>
A cons call creates a node for itself, a link for its first
argument and another link for its second argument. But two links
for one node is the reverse of what it should be. The trick is to
only count arguments as links if they are NON-nil. A nil argument
is like a null pointer. So <code>(cons nil nil)</code> is the singleton node
with no links. A cons call also creates a node for each NON-cons
argument. The <i>consp</i> predicate tells whether or not the lisp
object given it is a cons cell.
</p>

<p>
<code>(consp OBJECT) ; Returns t if OBJECT is a cons cell.</code>

The expression <code>(cons 'a 'b)</code> creates the three-node two-link tree:

<p>
A <b>binary</b> tree (the kind depicted so far) has <i>two</i> links emanating
from each node. Factor trees are binary, e.g.:
</p>

<pre class="example">
1234           5678
 /\             /\
2  617         2 2839
                  /\
                17 167
</pre>

<p>
To generalize, an <b>m-ary</b> tree has nodes with <i>m</i> links, or rather
<i>up to m</i> links, but to be a <b>regular</b> tree, all its nodes must
have <i>exactly</i> <i>m</i>. Returning to a counting theme, a connection
between Elementary Generative Combinatorics (EGC) and trees was
alluded to earlier. Generating lists of combinations of things
allows counting these combinations by simply getting the length of
a list. Factor trees generate prime factors, with easy-to-count
leaves, but a <i>different</i> <b>m</b> (also called <b>branching factor</b>) in
different parts of the tree applies to generating <i>all</i>
factors. The 24 factors of 360, whose prime factorization is \(2^3
   \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5\), are here listed at the bottom of this tree:
</p>

<pre class="example">

Multiplying together the three branching factors, 4 * 3 * 2 = 24, gives the total leaf count.

Another <i>m</i>-ary tree example is a <i>permutation</i> tree. For instance, to
generate all 24 (\(4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\)) permutations
of <code>[1 2 3 4]</code>, <i>m</i> goes from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 as the tree grows:

<p>
In a binary tree a node is also allowed to have only one link; if
so, we say it lacks 'completeness' or 'fullness'. Some nodes
legitimately have zero links. These are the <b>leaf</b> nodes, or the
<b>leaves</b> of the tree. Mixing the botanical and the genealogical
metaphors, a leaf node is also called a <i>childless</i> node. The
<b>children</b> of non-leaf nodes are distinguishable as either the
<b>left child</b> or the <b>right child</b>.
</p>

<p>
The node whose children are <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> is naturally called the
<b>parent</b> of <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>. That makes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> <b>siblings</b> in this
family tree. The parent of the parent of <code>u</code> is its <b>grandparent</b>,
<code>u</code> is its grandparent's <b>grandchild</b>, and so on, with <b>ancestor</b>
and <b>descendant</b> likewise defined genealogically.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rooted</b> trees differ from <b>unrooted</b> (or <b>free</b>) trees by having a
single node designated as the root. Family tree relationships hold
only in rooted trees, which breaks the symmetry of "is-related-to"
(a node is related to another node by a link connecting them) into
a child-to-parent or parent-to-child direction. Downwards away from
the root goes parent-to-child, upwards towards the root goes
child-to-parent. The <b>level</b> of a node is the number of links
between it and the root. The root node has level 0. The maximum
level taken over all leaf nodes is the <b>height</b> (or <b>depth</b>) of the
tree.
</p>

<p>
Back to building, creating the tree
</p>

<pre class="example">
 /\
a /\
 b  c
</pre>

<p>
in lisp is easy, it's <code>(cons 'a (cons 'b 'c))</code>, with 5 nodes and 4
links. The level of leaf node <i>a</i> is 1, the level of both <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
is 2, so the height of the tree is <code>(max 1 2 2)</code> <i>= 2</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now we'll build this tree:
</p>

<pre class="example">
 /\
a  \
   /\
  b  \
     /\
    c  \
       /\
      d nil
</pre>

<p>
From the bottom up, start with <code>(cons 'd nil)</code>. Moving up a level,
wrap that cons in another cons with car 'c: <code>(cons 'c (cons 'd
   nil))</code>. Continuing up the levels, <code>(cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c (cons 'd
   nil))))</code>. In other words, this tree is really the list <code>(a b c d)</code>,
with 9 nodes and 8 links, and its height is the length of the list,
namely 4.

<p>
In these simple examples, internal (non-leaf) nodes are different than
leaf nodes, in that the latter are the only ones whose car and cdr
pointees can be actual (non-cons) data. So building trees that store
arbitrary data items at all nodes, in addition to left- and
right-child links, requires a different tactic, a GPAO.

<b>Applications</b>
</p>

<p>
We now turn our attention to two tree applications whose beauty
and utility give them superstar status:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>fast searching</li>
<li>data compression</li>
</ol>

<p>
In searching for an item in a list of <i>orderable</i> items, there is
a slow (less efficient) way and a fast (more efficient) way. The
less efficient way is <b>linear search</b> &#x2014; or sequential search &#x2014;
in which the searched-for item (called a key) is compared with
each item in the list (or array/vector &#x2014; indeed any sequence
type) in a linear left-to-right front-to-back order. The items in
the list can be in any order, but orderable items are ones that
<i>can</i> be sorted. First putting them in sort order (typically,
ascending &#x2014; from "smallest" to "largest") leads to the more
efficient way, called <b>binary search</b>.  The non-tree binary search
algorithm normally uses an indexable array of data. We'll skip
taking a closer look at that and just focus on the tree version.
</p>

<p>
Key comparisons are usually three-way, but it takes a nested <code>if</code>
to discern:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>key1 &lt; key2</li>
<li>key1 = key2</li>
<li>key1 &gt; key2</li>
</ol>

<p>
as in the following example, which illustrates orderable numbers
as keys:

<p>
In <b>binary search</b>, after each step the search time is cut in
half, so a list of size 16 is reduced to a list of size 1 in 4
steps (counting arrows in \(16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4
    \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1\)). A size-one list is easy to search,
just check whether or not its single element compares as equal to
the search key.
</p>

<p>
A <b>binary search tree</b> (BST) is a binary tree with a key at each
node such that all keys in the node's left descendants (i.e.,
<b>subtree</b>) are <i>less than</i> the node's key, and all keys in the
node's right descendants (i.e., subtree) are <i>greater than</i> the
node's key. And of course, all keys at the node itself (all one of
them) are equal to that one key. Note that this application of
trees requires 'beefier' nodes than cons cells can easily provide.

<p>
Other characteristics of BSTs, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes
(keys), and <i>h</i> is the height of the tree, include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Search time is a logarithmic function of <i>n</i> (assuming a
<b>balanced</b> tree &#x2014; see below).</li>
<li>Insertion of a key is equally fast: search for the key, insert
it at the leaf where the search terminates.</li>
<li>For all operations (search, insert, delete) the worst case
number of key comparisons <i>= h + 1</i>.</li>
<li>\(\lfloor \mbox{lg}\ n\rfloor \le h \le n - 1\)</li>
<li>With average (random) data: \(h < 1.44\ \mbox{lg}\ n\)</li>
<li>With a poorly built (unbalanced) tree, in the worst case binary
search degenerates to a sequential search.</li>
<li>Inorder traversal produces a sorted list (the basis for the
<i>treesort</i> algorithm).</li>

<b>Building a BST</b>

order for ordering the keys/words, as in:

<b>Post-construction Binary Search Tree Insertion</b>
</p>

<p>
To insert a new word, <i>very</i>, into this BST, we must compare it to
'trees, then 'wonderfully. At this point the search terminates,
because 'wonderfully has no children. Note we needed two
comparisons to find 'very's insertion site, as the left child of
'wonderfully.  If a key is already in the BST, insertion of that
key has no effect.  It still costs some comparisons,
however. Inserting (futilely) 'cool costs 3 comparisons (the level
of 'cool plus one), and 'kind costs 6 comparisons.

<b>Expected Search Cost</b>
</p>

<p>
Binary search trees have <i>expected search costs</i>, which simply put
is the average cost of finding a key. Minimizing this cost for a
static (unchanging) tree and a set of keys whose access
frequencies are known in advance (think English words as might be
used by a spell-checker) is the <i>Optimal BST</i> scenario. GPAO.
</p>

<p>
Keys' search costs can be weighted based on how likely they are to
be looked up. Estimates of these likelihoods are usually good
enough if they can't be computed exactly, and the more accurate
the estimates, the speedier the average lookup. So an optimal BST
would have a common word like <i>is</i> near the root and a rarely used
word like <i>syzygy</i> near the leaves. Here are the search costs
(number of key comparisons) for the tree above:

A <b>Huffman tree</b> is <i>like</i> an optimal BST, but with a twist. It has a
different goal, that of encoding information efficiently, meaning it
minimizes the average number of bits per symbol (information atom). A
Huffman tree does this by storing more frequently-seen symbols closer
to the root and less-frequently-seen symbols further from the
root. Bits (<code>1s</code> and <code>0s</code>) are used to label the links on the path
from root to leaf, giving a unique bit string encoding for each
symbol.
</p>

<p>
Unlike a BST, a Huffman tree does not care about key order, and it
doesn't use internal (non-leaf) nodes to store the data (neither keys
nor bits). The only data items are the symbols, stored at the
leaves. The symbols' encodings are stored in the structure of the
tree. For example, consider the symbols <i>A</i> through <i>F</i> with the given
frequencies:

The encoding process begins with an initial <b>forest</b> of trees
(seedlings, actually). These are conveniently stored in a
<i>priority-queue</i> &#x2014; a data structure where high-priority items are
always maintained at the front of the queue. The nodes in this
collection are ordered by lowest-to-highest frequencies, as in the
table above, shown paired below.
</p>

<pre class="example">
([A 0.08] [B 0.10] [C 0.12] [D 0.15] [E 0.20] [F 0.35])
</pre>

<p>
The algorithm for building a Huffman tree creates an initial queue
<i>Q</i> of 1-node trees from pairs of <i>n</i> symbols and <i>n</i> weights,
which can be passed as pairs or as parallel arrays. The weights
are the frequencies &#x2014; how often the symbols (e.g., characters)
occur in some information (e.g., a body of text).  These
weights/frequencies define the priorities of the symbols, reverse
ordered, so the lower the weight, the higher the priority. Once
the tree is built, the weights can be forgotten, all that matters
is where the symbols are found in the tree.

By virtue of its construction as a tree, this encoding is
<b>prefix-free</b>, meaning no symbol's bit string is a prefix (initial
substring) of any other symbol's bit string. The compression is not
great, but serves to illustrate the point of all this work. A quick
measure of this encoding's success is, what is the average number of
bits used to encode a character?
</p>

<p>
\(3 \cdot 0.08 + 3 \cdot 0.10 + 3 \cdot 0.12 + 3 \cdot 0.15 + 2 \cdot 0.20 + 2 \cdot 0.35 = 2.45\)

A Huffman tree with <i>n</i> leaves has a total of <i>2n - 1</i> nodes, each of

"What are potential applications of graphs?" said Til. "Anything
and everything!" he answered his own question. And went on. "You
know the general meaning of the term 'graphs' in everyday math &#x2014;
a plot or chart of numerical data using a coordinate system &#x2014; as
in graphs of functions. Well, from now on when you hear the term I
want you to think first of its special meaning in discrete
mathematics, where a graph is <i>a technical type of discrete
structure that is useful for representing relations.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Graphs can represent relations, and relations can describe the
extension of <i>any</i> predicate, so <i>anything</i> describable by
relations is representable by graphs," Til said, and paused, and
right in tempo Ila asked, "What does that mean, a predicate's
extension?"  "I think I know," Abu said. "It's the set of all true
facts that predicate describes. But can't that set be infinite? How
does a graph represent that?" "Very carefully," Til chuckled and
winked.

Graphs have this intuitive knobs-and-lines visual representation,
just like trees. The difference is, of course, that graphs allow
<b>cycles</b>, a path from a node back to itself, which also implies the
existence of more than one path from one node to another (ponder
that). In this way graphs generalize trees analogous to the way
relations generalize functions.

<p>
<b>Adjacency</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be an undirected graph with edge set <i>E</i>. Let \(e \in E\)
be (or map to) the pair <code>[u v]</code>.
</p>

<p>
We say:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are <b>adjacent</b></li>
<li><i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are <b>neighbors</b></li>
<li><i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are <b>connected</b></li>
<li>Edge <i>e</i> is <b>incident with</b> nodes <i>u</i> and <i>v</i></li>
<li>Edge <i>e</i> <b>connects</b> <i>u</i> and <i>v</i></li>
<li>Nodes <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are the <b>endpoints</b> of edge <i>e</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Degree</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be an undirected graph, \(v \in V\) a vertex.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>degree</b> of <i>v</i>, denoted <i>deg(v)</i>, is the number of
incident edges to it, except that any self-loops are counted
twice</li>
<li>A vertex with degree 0 is called <b>isolated</b></li>
<li>A vertex with degree 1 is called <b>pendant</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Degree Sequence</b>
</p>

<p>
A sequence of the degrees of all nodes in a graph, listed in
nonincreasing order (highest to lowest), is the graph's <b>degree
sequence</b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the degree sequence of the knobs-and-lines graph is:
<code>[5 5 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 2]</code>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handshaking Theorem</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be an undirected (simple, multi-, or pseudo-) graph with
vertex set <i>V</i> and edge set <i>E</i>. Then the sum of the degrees of
the vertices in <i>V</i> is twice the size of <i>E</i>:
</p>

<p>
\[\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2|E|.\]
</p>

<p>
<b>Directed Adjacency</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a directed (possibly multi-) graph and let <i>e</i> be an
edge of <i>G</i> that is (or maps to) <code>[u v]</code>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>u</i> is <b>adjacent to</b> <i>v</i></li>
<li><i>v</i> is <b>adjacent from</b> <i>u</i></li>
<li><i>e</i> <b>comes from</b> <i>u</i></li>
<li><i>e</i> <b>goes to</b> <i>v</i></li>
<li><i>e</i> <b>connects</b> <i>u</i> to <i>v</i></li>
<li><i>e</i> <b>goes from</b> <i>u</i> to <i>v</i></li>
<li><i>u</i> is the <b>initial vertex</b> of <i>e</i></li>
<li><i>v</i> is the <b>terminal vertex</b> of <i>e</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Directed Degree</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a directed graph, <i>v</i> a vertex of <i>G</i>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>in-degree</b> of <i>v</i>, \(deg^-(v)\), is the number of edges
<b>going to</b> <i>v</i></li>
<li>The <b>out-degree</b> of <i>v</i>, \(deg^+(v)\), is the number of edges
<b>coming from</b> <i>v</i></li>
<li>The <b>degree</b> of <i>v</i> is just the sum of <i>v</i>'s in-degree and
out-degree, \(deg(v) = deg^-(v) + deg^+(v)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Directed Handshaking Theorem</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a directed (possibly multi-) graph with vertex set <i>V</i>
and edge set <i>E</i>. Then
</p>

<p>
\[\sum_{v \in V} deg^-(v) = \sum_{v \in V} deg^+(v) = \frac{1}{2}
    \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = |E|.\]
</p>

<p>
Note that the degree of a node is unchanged by whether its edges
are directed or undirected.

the phrase I'm using for this book's title has been around
awhile. I honestly do not know whether I heard or read it
online first, or if I thought it up independently. No

The debate rages on whether the adjective in the subtitle should be
<i>tireless</i> or <i>timeless</i>. Perhaps in a future printing the cover
will have a hologram showing it both ways, depending on the angle of
view.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps not. Ascribing the timelessness quality to <a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/possessive-ones-or-ones.1017/">one's</a> own work is
the height of hubris. The pinnacle of presumption. The acme of
arrogance. The depth of debauchery. The very idea. (Wait, that
breaks the pattern. &#9786;)
</p>

<p>
So it is <i>tireless</i> &#x2014; leaving the r-to-m transformation to its own
devices. Perhaps in that iffy future holographic printing the
transformation (transfiguration?) can be an animation that looks
like a natural process, like wax melting under a flame, or gravity
dictating the bounce of a ball. In the meantime, it is what it is
&#x2014; an obvious ploy for humor's sake? Or perhaps just a PWCT?
</p>

<p>
Parallel Word-Chain Transformations chain a sequence of word
transformations in lock-step. So maybe the 'a'-less subtitle could
move from "tireless work on play on words" to "tineless fork in clay
of woods" to "tuneless dork is claw if goods" and from thence (some
would say already) into madness and nonsense. &#9786;
</p>

<p>
Just say no. See word/phrase/sentence transformations for what they
are &#x2014; discrete mathematical operations on strings and sequences of
strings. No deeper meaning to them need be linked.

<dt>the mathematical idea of a set</dt><dd>A mathematician/computer
scientist wrote the following intriguing words: It is
impossible to improve upon [Georg] Cantor's succinct 1883
definition: <i>A set is a Many which allows itself to be thought
of as a One.</i> One of the most basic human faculties is the
perception of sets. [&#x2026;] When you think about your associates
and acquaintances you tend to organize your thought by sorting
these people into overlapping sets: friends, women, scientists,
drinkers, gardeners, sports fans, parents, etc. Or the books
that you own, the recipes that you know, the clothes you have
&#x2014; all of these bewildering data sets are organized, at the
most primitive level, by the simple and automatic process of
set formation, of picking out certain multiplicities that allow
themselves to be thought of as unities. Do sets exist even if
no one thinks of them? The numbers 2, 47, 48, 333, 400, and
1981 have no obvious property in common, yet it is clearly
<i>possible</i> to think of these numbers all at once, as I am now
doing. But must someone actually think of a set for it to
exist? [&#x2026;] The basic simplifying assumption of Cantorian set
theory is that sets are there already, regardless of whether
anyone does or could notice them. A set is not so much a
"<i>Many</i> which allows itself to be thought of as a <i>One</i>" as it
is a "Many which allows itself to be thought of as a One, if
someone with a large enough mind cared to try." For the set
theorist, the bust of Venus is already present in every block
of marble. And a set <b>M</b> consisting of ten billion random
natural numbers exists even though no human can ever see <b>M</b>
all at once. A set is the form of a possible thought, where
"possible" is taken in the broadest possible sense. &#x2014; Rudy
Rucker in <i>Infinity and The Mind: The Science and Philosophy of
the Infinite</i></dd>

<dt>we truncated the set <b>N</b></dt><dd>The set <b>N</b> of natural numbers
(including zero) is AKA the nonnegative numbers. Clarification:
in this context numbers mean integers, numbers with no
fractional parts, not even decimal points followed by nothing
(or nothing but zeros). The set <b>P</b> is <i>not</i> the set of
positive integers, that's called <b>Z<sup>+</sup></b>. <b>P</b> names the <b>prime</b>
numbers (but not always). <b>Z<sup>-</sup></b> is the negative integers, but
there's no abbreviation for the nonpositive integers, which is
<b>Z<sup>-</sup></b> together with 0. All together, <b>Z</b> is the short name

<dt>our rule also prefers</dt><dd>The vectors-over-lists preference has a
special reason, revealed IYI. But it's not just its
indexability. A lisp list can also be indexed, but the
operation is more expensive than a vector index (a quick add
offset and pointer dereference), as it must walk the list,
counting as it goes. Before we delve here into a bit of
algorithm analysis, what is an algorithm? The recipe analogy is
often used, but recipes for cooking are not the only kind. For
another, far more weighty example, see
<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng">https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng</a>
&#x2014; but it's interesting that Elder Perry ties the gospel
recipe back to the cooking kind. This kind features an implicit
"Step 0" that could be made explicit as: "Acquire all required
ingredients in the proper quantities." The "List of
Ingredients" is usually the first component of a recipe, with
"Directions" second.</dd>

<dt>they have a special name</dt><dd>When talking about logic, the noun
<b>predicate</b> &#x2014; to quote from the dictionary &#x2014; "is that part
of a proposition that is affirmed or denied about the subject."
For example, in the proposition "We are mortal," "mortal" (or
"is-mortal" or "are-mortal") is the predicate. <i>Any</i> statement
about something could "predicate" (the verb form) some general
term of that thing; however, convolution may result. For
example, "The main purpose of the Doctrine and Covenants [&#x2026;]
is to implement the law of consecration." It's not easy to pull
out a term which, predicated of "the Doctrine and Covenants",
has the same meaning. So if we're saying <code>P(x)</code>, where <code>x</code>
stands for "the Doctrine and Covenants", what does <code>P</code> stand
for? How about this? <code>P</code> stands for
"to-implement-the-law-of-consecration-main-purpose-of". Just
saying <code>P(x)</code> (or lisp-style, <code>(P x)</code>) is easier. Let it stand
for any desired sentence with an <code>x</code> in it. It's not necessary
