* TODO Apply Bayes\rsquo{} Theorem

  Automating the process of finding bugs in source code requires the use of
  heuristics, or pattern-matching on the code. There is no deep understanding
  of the code involved, hence such a tool cannot be perfect at detecting bugs.
  A certain bug-detection tool is correct 80% of the time and incorrect the
  rest of the time. This means that on average out of every 100 bugs, the tool
  will detect 80 of them, and fail to detect 20 of them. Also, out of 100
  non-bugs, the tool will report 20 bugs and 80 non-bugs, on average. The tool
  is run on source code that is 10% buggy. That is, one line out of every ten
  contains a bug. Given that the tool detects a bug in some line of code, what
  is the probability that this line of code actually contains a bug?

* TODO Compute Four Leaves

  Using the information in the previous task, calculate to two-decimal-digit
  precision the values that go at the leaves of the binary tree shown below,
  where the arrow pointing to the topmost leaf is labeled to show what goes
  there. Hint: The four leaves correspond to the four quadrants of trutH versus
  tesT described in the file on [[file:~/mebewiyo/W17/2dm/week07/bayes-theorem.org][Bayes\rsquo{} Theorem]].

* TODO Apply Your Probability Knowledge

  There are three sheets of paper in a folder. One sheet has writing on both
  sides, one has writing on one side and is blank on the other side, and the
  third sheet of paper is blank on both sides. Without looking you randomly pull
  one sheet of paper out of the folder and see that it is blank on the side
  you\rsquo{}re looking at. What is the probability that the other side is blank as
  well?

* TODO Apply Bayes\rsquo{} Theorem Generalized

  Three different vegetables, turnips, eggplant and asparagus, make Bill sick
  sometimes. There is a 50% chance he will be sick if he eats turnips. If he
  eats eggplant, there is a 20% chance he will be sick. The probability that he
  will be sick when he eats asparagus is only 5%.

  Bill gets sick after dinner where he ate one of those three vegetables. What
  is the probability that he ate turnips?

  (Assume that for each of the three vegetables, there is a 1/3 chance he ate
  it.)

* TODO Apply Bayes\rsquo{} Theorem Generalized With Different Priors

  Change the prior probabilities of Bill eating these vegetables to a 30% chance
  he ate turnips, a 10% chance he ate eggplant, and a 60% chance he ate
  asparagus?

  Now what is the probability that Bill ate turnips, given that he got sick?
