* An Aim for the Noblest Desire
  The pursuit of knowledge and truth. That\rsquo{}s really what we\rsquo{}re about, isn\rsquo{}t it?
  As citizens of Planet Earth, as affiliates of this university, and most
  especially as members of the Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints,
  knowledge is our business. Of course, the pursuit of knowledge is one thing,
  but it\rsquo{}s quite another thing to catch it! To \ldquo{}get it,\rdquo that\rsquo{}s the end toward
  which we aim. Or to use another word---a longer word---to /apprehend/
  truth---as when the long arm of the law reaches out to apprehend a criminal.
  We really do want to get it, and not be as Paul described to Timothy \ldquo{}ever
  learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth\rdquo---which capped
  his list of awful things he prophesied would be part and parcel of the
  perilous times of the last days.

  Which days we are in. My aim here is, with help from other sources, the
  sharing of my own quirky angle on this subject, acquired over the course of my
  days on Planet Earth. I wish to reveal to you a tiny bit of the current state
  of my quest---my personal odyssey---and I also earnestly hope that the Spirit
  will edify and uplift you in the process. Because as we know, \ldquo{}The Spirit
  speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they
  really are, and of things as they really will be.\rdquo (Jacob 4:13)

  Begin with one source.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The Lord defined truth as things as they are, as they were, and as they will
  be. But as long as we remain human, we are consistently at least one step away
  from the truth. In the search for truth, we have no direct contact with things
  as they are, were, and will be. Past events are relayed to us through
  observers, who, no matter how honest they were, still color their observations
  with their prejudices. Our own prejudices cloud our vision of things as they
  are. The prophets relay to us a vision of the future, but it is impossible to
  collate those visions into a clear, accurate forecast of all that will take
  place. We discover truth through many means. Observation tells us not what
  happened, but what was observed to have happened. Generalization tells us not
  what happens, but what has always happened in similar or identical cases so
  far. Prediction tells us not what will happen, but what the evidence leads
  some individuals to believe will happen. Prescription tells us not what
  /should/ happen, but what individuals /desire/ to have happen. Whether it will
  really be good or not will only be revealed in the actual event.

  Indeed, the shakiest of all approaches to truth is prescription, because it
  invariably depends on the accuracy of our prediction. When a doctor prescribes
  penicillin, it is because penicillin has been proven many times in the past to
  relieve the particular symptoms you exhibit. It is because of the doctor\rsquo{}s
  prediction that penicillin will cure your ailment that he prescribes it.

  There is a great deal of evidence to support the idea that penicillin is worth
  prescribing. However, when you move away from physics, chemistry, or the other
  hard sciences, prediction gets pretty shaky. Into the realm of history and
  politics and psychology and sociology prediction ceases to be what /will/
  happen---it becomes what /might/ happen. Despite the much vaunted
  repetitiveness of history, history does not repeat in detail. Empires may rise
  and fall along the same patterns, but in its relentless progression the event
  still unwinds one day at a time, and no two days are ever identical. So
  predictions of human behavior---those grand speculations on what /might/
  happen---are not based on experience of what happens every time the experiment
  is repeated. Those predictions are based on conclusions drawn from a
  collection of independent events that may or may not have relation to the
  event in question. In predicting human behavior, we find ourselves relying on
  statements that boil down to what might have happened, what we /think/
  happened, and---the most dangerous of all---what would have happened /if
  only/.

  /If only/. If only there had not been sex education in school, my daughter
  would not be pregnant. If only there /had/ been sex education in school, my
  daughter would not be pregnant.

  If only textbooks could be brought into line, our children would not think
  incorrect thoughts.

  If only the novels that showed sex and violence could be banned, our terrible
  crime problems would be solved.

  If only John Gacy\rsquo{}s father had not been cold and distant from him, Gacy would
  not have killed a score of innocent young men.

  If only we could get people to stop mentioning ugliness, the world would be
  beautiful.

  So much prescription depends on that phrase \ldquo{}if only.\rdquo And yet \ldquo{}if only\rdquo
  contains two vicious lies that make that phrase the eternal enemy of truth.

  The first lie is the word /only/: Its root is the word /one/, implying a
  singleness that never occurs in real life. It implies that a single change
  would have a single effect, which is absurd on its face---for instance, the
  popular lie that /if only/ Chamberlain had not tried to pacify Hitler and
  instead had taken firm action years earlier to stop the Hitler menace, the
  Second World War could have been avoided. Isn\rsquo{}t that nice? Isn\rsquo{}t it pleasant
  to think wistfully about how easily such a tragedy could be avoided, and how
  easily we could avoid it in the future? Yet Chamberlain\rsquo{}s pacification
  attempts were themselves an effect, not a cause. If he had even suggested
  going to war with Hitler before the invasion of Poland, his government would
  have collapsed and the English would have replaced him with a government that
  would try, as he did, to avoid war. And if England and France had invaded
  Germany long before Hitler\rsquo{}s buildup was complete, wouldn\rsquo{}t we today condemn
  that action as vicious warmongering? There is no single cause of an event, and
  no single result from any change.

  The second lie is the word /if/: /If/ implies that the predictor has a perfect
  knowledge of the cause-and-effect chain. But that perfect knowledge has not
  been vouchsafed to any man. That is one of the meanings of the veil that
  blinds us to eternal things. We live in time, day to day, and the world is
  narrowed to what we can perceive with our own senses and learn from those who
  teach us. If we had the perfect knowledge that God has, it would be no test
  for us here; we are kept in ignorance because only in ignorance are we able to
  reveal to God and to ourselves who we really are. We do not know what would
  have happened /if only/ we had done something different; we only know the
  desires of our own heart, and the act, but not the long string of consequences
  that extends infinitely from the act. We are not so implacable as the Greeks.
  We Latter-day Saints do not believe that God would punish Oedipus for sins he
  never desired to commit. \ldquo{}If only\rdquo has no meaning to us.

  --- /Orson Scott Card/ from his book of essays entitled /A Storyteller in Zion/.

* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and discuss these ideas in the context of what you have achieved
  (or will have achieved) regarding this week\rsquo{}s assignment. Focus particularly
  on the simplification of the \ldquo{}cause-and-effect chain\rdquo the na\iuml{}ve Bayesian
  approach takes.

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students\rsquo{} answers, either adding to their 
  answers, or comparing/contrasting theirs to/with yours.
