** TODO KDB *
#+begin_note

  =NM=, identifying the shortest path(s) and the longest path(s).
#+end_note
#+begin_info

** TODO ABR *
#+begin_note
  Directed graphs (/digraphs/ for short) can represent binary relations. Make a
  connection between the four relation types and the existence or non-existence
  of certain features in the graph of the relation.

  - Reflexive = /every/ node has a link that is a loop.
  - Symmetric = there are /no/ single link arrows (one-way trips) --- every link
    arrow is a double one (roundtrip).
  - Antisymmetric = there is /no/ double arrow (going both ways) /unless/ it is
    a loop.
  - Transitive = there is /no/ two-leg journey (think flight with a layover)
    without a shortcut (non-stop flight).

  It is helpful to draw a graph of a relation that is described more abstractly.
  For an example of an abstract description, here is the relation on the set [1
  2 3] given by this vector of \ldquo{}conses\rdquo (another way to say /dotted pairs/)
  representing the ordered pairs:

  [(1 . 1) (1 . 2) (2 . 2) (3 . 3)]

  And here is the three-node four-link graph of that relation:
  [[file:../img/fig-digraph-of-binary-relation.png]]

  Identify which features listed above this graph has. Draw the digraphs of some
  other abstract binary relations, with and without the four features.

** TODO HRR
#+begin_note
  In another multigraph example, what is the connection between this graph and
  the \ldquo{}birth of graph theory\rdquo?

  [[file:../img/fig-four-nodes-seven-links.png]]

  What do its nodes and links represent? What is its degree sequence?

  Explore the graph property \ldquo{}Eulerian\rdquo. Does this graph have it? Describe
  necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian.
