  Expand to two nested quantifiers the code you created for one quantifier.

  Specifically, implement these four functions, shown side-by-side with their
  symbolic logic equivalents:

  | Function Name     | In Symbols  |
  |-------------------+-------------|
  | for-all-for-all   | $\forall{}$ x $\forall{}$ y |
  | for-all-for-some  | $\forall{}$ x $\exists{}$ y |
  | for-some-for-all  | $\exists{}$ x $\forall{}$ y |
  | for-some-for-some | $\exists{}$ x $\exists{}$ y |

  Let\rsquo{}s examine these quantifications in the context of loops and a generic
  predicate P. These will be /nested/ loops, an outer one wrapping an inner one,
  because /nested/ quantification is what is being expressed. The predicate
  (function) call (P x y) goes in the inner loop, which controls the y, while
  the outer loop controls the x.

  \ldquo{}For all x for all y\rdquo wants to find (P x y) always true. That\rsquo{}s what it means
  for the nested quantification to be true, and naturally, this only works if
  the domains of x and y are finite. Even then, it really only /works/ if these
  domains are reasonably finite --- not /too/ big. Iteration is serial, after
  all, and time is short.

  So, for-all-for-all loops through x\rsquo{}s domain, and for each x loops through
  each y in y\rsquo{}s domain. On each inner-loop iteration it calls (P x y) and checks
  the value. If the value is ever false, then for-all-for-all is false ---
  immediately --- no need to check any further. Some y has been found for some x
  where the predicate is false. If both loops finish with nary a false
  evaluation, for-all-for-all is ultimately true. There is no x for which, for
  any y, (P x y) is false.

  The other function with similarly relatively simple logic is
  for-some-for-some. This function loops through x\rsquo{}s domain, and for each x
  loops through each y in y\rsquo{}s domain. On each inner-loop iteration it calls (P x
  y) and checks the value. If a true value is found, then for-some-for-some is
  true --- immediately --- no need to check any further. If both loops finish
  never having triggered true, for-some-for-some is ultimately false. There is
  no x for which there is some y for which (P x y) is true.

  The other two are trickier. \ldquo{}For all x for some y\rdquo wants (P x y) to always be
  true sometimes, and \ldquo{}for some x for all y\rdquo wants (P x y) to sometimes be true
  always. Implement for-all-for-some and for-some-for-all the best, most elegant
  way you can.

  Test your implementations of these four functions using a suitable binary
  (arity 2) predicate, for example =>=.

  - 21. :: /And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that
