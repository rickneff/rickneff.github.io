  A function-as-association between elements of a domain and elements of a
  codomain, for \ldquo{}small\rdquo domains and codomains, inspired so-called \ldquo{}association
  lists\rdquo (or alists) and the =assoc= (and associated) functions.

  =(assoc KEY LIST)= returns non-nil if KEY is \ldquo{}equal\rdquo to the first element of
  an element of LIST. The value is actually the first element of LIST whose
  first element equals KEY.

  For example, here is a function that uses an alist to look up the RGB values
  of a given color name:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun lookup-rgb (color-name)
    (rest (assoc color-name
                 '(("red" 255 0 0) ("green" 0 255 0) ("blue" 0 0 255)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "blue")
#+END_SRC

: (0 0 255)

  What if the color name is not in the alist?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "grue")
#+END_SRC

: nil

  There are several variations of =assoc=. Find and give examples of using them.

** TODO WFK
#+begin_note
  In the function-as-map context, here is another interpretation:

  A \ldquo{}map\rdquo type (AKA associative array, AKA hashtable) is found in many
  languages. For example, C++:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output
  #include <iostream>
  #include <map>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
     map<string, string> mymap;

     mymap["one"] = "red";
     mymap["two"] = "blue";
     mymap["three"] = "green";

     for (auto const &ent1 : mymap) {
        cout << ent1.first << " : " << ent1.second << endl;
     }
  }
#+END_SRC

: one : red
: three : green
: two : blue

  And python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  mymap = {}

  mymap["one"] = "red"
  mymap["two"] = "blue"
  mymap["three"] = "green"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
          for key in mymap.keys():
                  print key + " : " + str(mymap[key])
#+END_SRC

: three : green
: two : blue
: one : red

  And of course elisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
  (let* ((mymap (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))
    (puthash "one" "red" mymap)
    (puthash "two" "blue" mymap)
    (puthash "three" "green" mymap)
    (pp (list (gethash "one" mymap)
              (gethash "two" mymap)
              (gethash "three" mymap)))
    (maphash (lambda (key value) (princ (format "%s : %s\n" key value))) mymap))
#+END_SRC

: ("red" "blue" "green")
: one : red
: two : blue
: three : green

  What happens if you omit the =:test 'equal= parameters to the
  =make-hash-table= call?

#+begin_note
  This exercise explores /looping/ versus /mapping/.

  What does the =morphify= function defined below do? Think about it, then PVP
  the result of the call to it that follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphify (fun lst)
    (loop for item in lst
          collect (funcall fun item)))
#+END_SRC

  Note the quotes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (morphify (quote downcase) (quote ("THIS" "IS" "TOO" "LOUD")))
#+END_SRC

  The =morphify= function is essentially a /mapping/ function, which means it
  takes a passed-in function (=fun=) and a passed-in list (=lst=), and /maps fun
  over lst/, i.e., the results of calling the function =fun= on each element of
  the list =lst= are collected into a new list, which is returned.

  This shows one way (iteratively) a /map/ function could be implemented.
  Another way is /recursively/, as in:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphifyr (fun lst)
    (if (null lst)
        nil
      (append (list (funcall fun (first lst))) (morphifyr fun (rest lst)))))
#+END_SRC

#+END_SRC

  A function is one-to-one if and only if it is onto, /provided/ its domain and
  codomain are the same size.

  Put this statement in symbolic form using the adjectives /injective/ and
  /surjective/, and argue for its truth using the following formal definitions:

  A function from domain A to codomain B

  f : A \rarr B

  is
  - injective :: if f(m) \ne f(n) whenever m \ne n, for all m \in A and for all n \in A;

  and/or is
  - surjective :: if for all b \in B there exists an a \in A such that f(a) = b.

  This is a good time to mention that functions with arity /n/ for /n/ = 1
  (unary) and /n/ = 2 (binary) have alternate type names, as does a generic
  classification for /n/ > 2:

  Prefix notation takes some getting used to. Converting an expression from
  prefix to infix, to make arithmetic look more \ldquo{}natural\rdquo, is as easy as
  swapping the first two elements of a three-element list; e.g., =(+ 1 2)=
  becomes =(1 + 2)=. But what if the expression has other expressions nested
  within it, e.g., =(- 10 (* 2 3))=, where one (or both) of the operands is
  another 3-element (prefix expression) list? Recursively applying the swapping
  rule is the answer!

  Study the =prefix->infix= function and the three sample calls to it. Describe
  how it works. Try it on more complex expressions. Re-implement it without
  using =let= or =cond= (use =if=).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
