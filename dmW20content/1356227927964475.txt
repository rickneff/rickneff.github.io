  What does a desert have to do with the study of discrete mathematics?

  Well, it\rsquo{}s obvious that sand is a discrete kind of thing. Clump together
  enough grains of sand and you get a sea of sand, a desert. As opposed to a sea
  of water, an ocean, a continuous substance. Zoom in close enough, however, and
  an ocean is a collection of individual water molecules, again discrete.

  More metaphorically, it could suggest that we sometimes think of discrete
  mathematics as a \ldquo{}dry\rdquo topic?! Or perhaps it means that if we work alone, we
  can get lost in the \ldquo{}sands of time\rdquo --- meaning that it will be a long and
  lonely adventure if we try to do it all by ourselves!

  But this desert image also conjures up all that might be buried beneath the
  sand. We\rsquo{}ve all heard stories of possible lost libraries, cities and the
  knowledge that the desert civilizations once had being swallowed up in the
  sand, resulting in it being lost until archaeologists uncover it again. That is
  somewhat representative of discrete math, or math in general. Math can explain
  the world around us, but sometimes the math is hidden, and we have to bring it
  up to the surface.

  Searching the web based on the hint and the one word that did not get
  dehydrated, using the search terms /Carroll Cabbages/ reveals the answer. This
  is from the nonsense poem Carroll called \ldquo{}The Walrus and the Carpenter\rdquo in his
  1872 book /Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There/:

  THE TIME HAS COME THE WALRUS SAID TO TALK OF MANY THINGS OF SHOES AND SHIPS
  AND SEALING WAX OF CABBAGES AND KINGS AND WHY THE SEA IS BOILING HOT AND
  WHETHER PIGS HAVE WINGS

  A search of online or ondisk English dictionaries or word lists will reveal
  that the word \lsquo{}strengths\rsquo has a CVR of 8/1. Other answers (less common words)
  with higher (finite) CVRs are acceptable.

  The limiting radius (r_\infty) of the outermost circle is 8.700 (approximately).

  A good answer includes the method, and if you wrote code, the code you used to
  find it. For example, this Python solution:
#+end_info
#+begin_src python
from math import *

radius = 1.0
for n in range (3, 10000000):
   radius *= 1/cos(pi/n)
return radius
#+end_src

#+results:
: 8.7000323368

  This problem has a fascinating history, presented in /The Math Book/ by
  Clifford Pickover, and excerpted for your consideration, profit and learning
  in the following images:

*** Rephrase
    For many different numbers, call each k, make the product of k, k + 1, and
    2k + 1. Find the pattern in these products.
*** Approach
    Following the hints, create a table looking at k \cdot (k + 1) \cdot (2k + 1) and
    that product divided by 6 for several consecutive values of k, starting
    at 1. Look for patterns between consecutive elements, or in the sequence as
    a whole.
*** Solution
    Each product is divisible by 6:
    | k | k + 1 | 2k + 1 | Product | Product/6 |
    |---+-------+--------+---------+-----------|
    | 1 |     2 |      3 |       6 |         1 |
    | 2 |     3 |      5 |      30 |         5 |
    | 3 |     4 |      7 |      84 |        14 |
    | 4 |     5 |      9 |     180 |        30 |
    | 5 |     6 |     11 |     330 |        55 |
*** Proof
    The differences between the k^{th} and the (k-1)^{th} Product/6 values
    are k^2, the squares. Shown by:

    | (k)(k+1)(2k+1)/6 - (k-1)(k)(2k-1)/6 | = | [(k)(k+1)(2k+1) - (k-1)(k)(2k-1)]/6           |
    |                                     | = | [(k^2 + k)(2k + 1) - (k^2 - k)(2k - 1)]/6       |
    |                                     | = | [2k^3 + 2k^2 + k^2 + k - (2k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + k)]/6 |
    |                                     | = | [2k^3 - 2k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k^2 + k - k]/6             |
    |                                     | = | [6k^2]/6                                       |
    |                                     | = | k^2                                            |

	  The numbers 1, 5, 14, 30, 55 \dots are called the [[https://oeis.org/A000330][/square pyramidal numbers/]]:
    a(k) = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + k^2

*** Rephrase
    Is there a pattern connecting 654321 with CLAHCK? If so find it.
*** Approach
    Using \lsquo{}CLOCK\rsquo as a hint, treat the numbers as times by inserting a colon after
    their first digits:

    6:54 3:21

    Then do a little clock arithmetic and find the difference between those two
    times (treating the first as AM, the second as PM). Look for more patterns.
*** Solution
    If you divide 654321 into 654 321 and add then you get 975 which, when
    converted to hex, is 3CF which is the corresponding hex value of the first 3
    letters of CLOCK- CLO -> 3 12 15 or 3CF

    From 7 AM to 3 PM is 8 hours. Add the 6 minutes before 7 AM to the 21 minutes
    after 3 PM to get 27 minutes.

    8 hours and 27 minutes. 8 and 27.

    Using a reasonable alphabetic-order decoding, if A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc.,
    then K = 11:

    C is the Least Of CLOCK, K is the Last Of CLOCK, C LOC K invites the focus to
    be on the first (least) and last letters, which have 3 and 11 as number
    equivalents. How now to relate 3 and 11 to 8 and 27?

    Factor 8 and 27 into 2^3 and 3^3, take just the exponents, 3 and 3, concatenate
    them to make the number 33. There you have it: the prime factors of 33 are 3
    and 11.
*** Proof
    The proof of the solution resides in it being the explanation given by
    Brother Neff of this puzzle he created.

    ASK him if you could have figured this out without talking to him, or some
    former student who remembers doing this puzzle.
