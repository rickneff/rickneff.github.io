  Please do the following Chapter 15 exercises (comments from Ganesh):

* Exercise 15.2.3.1
  is a warmup and encourages the use of the tool.
* Exercise 15.2.3.4
  is good, as it shows that 0's and 1's matter -- not just 0's (i.e. a zebra and not a donkey).
* Exercise 15.2.3.5
  is great to show one use of PCP (it is medium-hard).
* Exercise 15.5.1.3
  is good, as it builds on something already done, and it shows how \ldquo{}label surgery\rdquo on a TM is done.
* Exercise 15.5.1.5
  is good and not that hard (resembles Fig 15.10) as it does cause some mental pushups to be exercised.
