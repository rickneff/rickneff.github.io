* Applications of Discrete Mathematics
- Formal Languages (computer languages)
- Natural Languages (people languages)
- Data Structures
- Algorithm Design
- Compiler Design
- Relational Database Theory
- Computability Theory
- ...
* All of these (except one)
   are built on the foundation of /formal/ logic.
** As Opposed to Everyday Logic?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When we think, we bring a variety of thoughts together into some order. When
  the combination of thoughts are mutually supporting and make sense in
  combination, the thinking is “logical.” When the combination is not mutually
  supporting, is contradictory in some sense, or does not “make sense,” the
  combination is \ldquo{}not logical.”

  --- Richard Paul and Linda Elder, /Critical Thinking, Concepts & Tools/

* Questions
  - Why is it important to think logically?
  - Why learn logic (formal or informal)?
* Answers
 - Logic gives you a tool that 99.9% of the population lacks.
 - Logic sharpens your thinking, allowing it to “cut” more powerfully.
 - Logic gives you a means to mechanize reasoning.
** What does that mean?
   Mechanizing reasoning means programming a computer to do it.
** The Proposition
  Time flies like an arrow.

** The Problem
  According to Steven Pinker:

  The problem is that computer parsers are too *meticulous* for their own good.
  They find ambiguities that are quite legitimate, as far as English grammar is
  concerned, but that would never occur to a sane person. One of the first
  computer parsers provided this famous example ... by finding, to the surprise
  of the programmers, five different meanings for these five words.

*** Meaning 1 (the intended reading)

   Time proceeds as quickly as an arrow proceeds.

*** Meaning 2

   Measure the speed of flies in the same way that you measure the
   speed of an arrow.

*** Meaning 3

   Measure the speed of flies in the same way that an arrow measures
   the speed of flies.

*** Meaning 4

   Measure the speed of flies that resemble an arrow.

*** Meaning 5

   Flies of a particular kind, time-flies, are fond of an arrow.

*** An Aphorism to Capture the Moment

   Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
* Rules
  To reason logically and make correct inferences, you have to follow some
  rules --- Rules of Inference. Here are a few:

*** Rule 1
    If you have p and you have p \rarr q (if p then q), you can infer q.
*** Rule 2
    If you have \not{}q and you have p \rarr q (if p then q), you can infer \not{}p.
*** Rule 3
    If you have p \rarr q and you have q \rarr r, you can infer p \rarr r.
*** Rule 4
    If you have p \lor q and you have \not{}q, you can infer p.
*** Apply
    You are about to leave for school in the morning and discover that you don’t
    have your glasses.

    You know the following statements are true:

    a. If I was reading the newspaper in the kitchen, then my glasses are on the
    kitchen table.
    b. If my glasses are on the kitchen table, then I saw them at breakfast.
    c. I did not see my glasses at breakfast.
    d. I was reading the newspaper in the living room or I was reading the
    newspaper in the kitchen.
    e. If I was reading the newspaper in the living room then my glasses are on
    the coffee table.

    Where are your glasses?
**** Solution
    Let RK = I was reading the newspaper in the kitchen,
        GK = My glasses are on the kitchen table,
        SB = I saw my glasses at breakfast,
        RL = I was reading the newspaper in the living room,
        GC = My glasses are on the coffee table.

    You have the following as \ldquo{}premises\rdquo:

    1. RK \rarr GK
    2. GK \rarr SB
    3. \not{}SB
    4. RL \lor RK
    5. RL \rarr GC

    Starting with your premises, build your argument step by step:

    | Step | Inference | Reason       |
    |------+-----------+--------------|
    |    1 | RK \rarr GK   | premise      |
    |    2 | GK \rarr SB   | premise      |
    |    3 | \not{}SB       | premise      |
    |    4 | RL \lor RK   | premise      |
    |    5 | RL \rarr GC   | premise      |
    |    6 | \not{}GK       | 3, 2, Rule 2 |
    |    7 | \not{}RK       | 6, 1, Rule 2 |
    |    8 | RL        | 7, 4, Rule 4 |
    |    9 | GC        | 8, 5, Rule 1 |

    Your glasses on the coffee table.
***** Shorter Solution Possible?
      Try to build a solution using Rule 3 somewhere.
      Is it a shorter (fewer rows) solution?
