* TODO Learn About Infinite Sets
** TODO Who Can Name TBN
   the BIGGEST number?
** TODO Who Can Explain
   a Set-Theoretic Paradox?
*** For example
    *Russell's paradox*
**** Which says
     Let S be the set that contains a set x if the set x does not belong to
     itself, so that S = {x | x \notin x}.

***** Contradictory!
      1. Show that the assumption that S is a member of S leads to a
         contradiction.
****** Why?
     By definition S \in S means S is *not* a member of S.
******* Paradoxical!
       2. Show that the assumption that S is *not* a member of S leads
          to a contradiction.
******** Why?
         By definition S \notin S means S \in S.
**** An Analogy
     Divide the set of words into two sets:
***** 1
      self-describing words
****** For example
       small, polysyllabic, awkwardnessful
***** 2
      NON-self-describing
****** For example
       long, monosyllabic, edible

       Call Set 1 the autological words.
       Call Set 2 the heterological words.

** TODO Get Technical
*** Learn How to Compare Set Sizes

    Let S and T be (finite or infinite) sets.

    Recall that |S| and |T| denote the *cardinality* of S and T, respectively.

    Define |S| = |T| (the cardinalities of S and T are *equal* iff there is a
    /one-to-one correspondence/ from S to T.

    Define |S| \le |T| (the cardinality of S is *less than or equal to* the
    cardinality of T) iff there is a one-to-one /function/ from S to T.

    If |S| \le |T| but |S| \ne |T|

    then |S| < |T|

    (the cardinality of S is *strictly less* than the cardinality of T).
***** Also works for \sube
      if A \sube B but A \neq B then A \subset B.
*** Squeeze play

    |S| = |T| iff |S| \le |T| and |T| \le |S|.

**** In first-order logic
     p \leftrightarrow q \equiv (p \rarr q) \land (p \larr q)

**** Squeeze Play Example: Legal C Programs

     Exactly how many legal C programs are there?

     Note: /legal/ does not mean useful, or meaningful, or even /compilable/!

     Infinitely many, but how do we show that it is a /countable/ infinity?

     Let LCP = {x | x is a string containing a legal C program}.

     Let N = {0, 1, 2, 3, \dots } (the set of all natural numbers).

**** What is an injection from N to LCP?

     f_1 : N \rightarrow LCP
***** One of many mappings
      0 \rightarrow  "main(){}"

      1 \rightarrow  "main(){;}"

      2 \rightarrow  "main(){;;}"
      \dots
      n \rightarrow  "main(){;;; \dots ;}"
      \dots

**** What is an injection from LCP to N?

     f_2 : LCP \rightarrow N

     f_2 looks at each program in LCP as a bitstring, and returns the equivalent
        unsigned binary integer (converted to decimal).

     LCP_0 \rightarrow  1398

     LCP_1 \rightarrow  62308

     LCP_2 \rightarrow  730129
     \dots
     LCP_n \rightarrow  987131734445134773
     \dots

     Since by definition, the existence of f_1 guarantees that |N| \leq |LCP|,

     and the existence of f_2 guarantees that |LCP| \leq |N|,

     it follows that |N| = |LCP|.
**** QED
     Thus, there are as many legal C programs as there are natural numbers.

*** Ponder me this

    Does a proper subset always have a smaller cardinality?

    If we deal with finite sets, then S \subset T always implies |S| < |T|.

    But for infinite sets, /this is not necessarily the case!/

    Let E be the set of even natural numbers. How does its cardinality relate
    to the cardinality of N (the set of all natural numbers)?

    Let f : N \rightarrow E be defined by f(n) = 2n.

    Then f is a one-to-one correspondence, therefore |E| = |N|.

    | N: | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |  6 |  7 | \dots |
    | E: | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | \dots |

*** Ponder me this too

    Do all infinite sets have the same cardinality?
**** The answer is
     *NO!* It would be incredibly uninteresting if they did. But
     finding sets of different infinite sizes is another matter.

     It\rsquo{}s fairly easy to see that the cardinality of the positive integers is
     equal to the cardinality of the positive rationals.

     It's a little harder to show that |Z^{+}| = |Q|.

     Still, there /are/ cardinalities strictly greater than |Z^{+}|.

**** In particular
      |R| > |Z^{+}^{}| (there are \ldquo{}more\rdquo real numbers than positive integers)!

**** Define the difference
     Sets that are finite or have the same cardinality as Z^{+} (or N, it doesn't
     matter) are called *countable*.

     Countable sets are sets whose elements can be *listed*.

     e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots, e_n (if the set is finite) or

     e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots (if the set is infinite).

***** By Contrast

      Uncountable sets are sets whose elements *CANNOT* be listed.

   |P(Z^{+})| > |Z^{+}|

   |S| \le |T| if there is a one-to-one /mapping/ between S and T

   |Z^{+}| \ne |P(Z^{+})| must be argued for and proven to conclude |Z^{+}| < |P(Z^{+})|
