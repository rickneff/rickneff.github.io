#+begin_note
  There are shortcuts for determining divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  and 11. Of course, using the =is-divisible-by= function is the easy way, but
  in case the modulus function were somehow off limits, or only worked for numbers
  that aren\rsquo{}t too big, these shortcuts are helpful.

  In the following list /N/ (preceding the colon) is short for /A number is
  divisible by N if/.

  - 2: the units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.
  - 3: the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
  - 4: the number formed by the 2 rightmost digits is divisible by 4.
  - 5: the units digit is 0 or 5.
  - 6: it passes the shortcuts for 2 /and/ 3.
  - 7: it has a zero remainder from \ldquo{}short\rdquo division, where you ignore partial
    quotients, and just keep remainders.
  - 8: the number formed by the 3 rightmost digits is divisible by 8.
  - 9: the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.
  - 10: the units digit is a zero. (It must pass shortcuts for 2 /and/ 5).
  - 11: you add up every other digit into /sum1/, you add up the rest that you
    didn\rsquo{}t already add into /sum2/, and if the difference between /sum1/ and
    /sum2/ is divisible by 11, the original number is.

  Write elisp functions implementing these shortcuts and test them on several
  numbers (e.g., 13097034951). The first two are given to you (7 is the hardest):

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun is-divisible-by-2 (n)

:HINT:
  - Hint :: This problem is potentially time-consuming.

  Found with a quick google search:

  To find out if a number is divisible by seven, take the last digit, double it,
  and subtract it from the rest of the number. If you get an answer divisible by
  7 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by seven. If you
  don't know the new number's divisibility, you can apply the rule again.

  Which do you think is easier, this rule or the short division rule?

  How many divisors does a given number have?

  Take 36. By trial division (trying successive divisors, starting with 1, which
  remember divides everything) we see that

  36 =

  1 ⋅ 36 (that’s 2),
  2 ⋅ 18 (another 2),
  3 ⋅ 12 (2 more),
  4 ⋅ 9 (2 more),

  From the \(42^{nd}\) International Mathematical Olympiad:

  Let $n$ be an odd integer greater than 1 and let $c_1, c_2, \dots{}, c_n$ be
  integers.

  For each permutation $a = (a_1, a_2, \dots{}, a_n)$ of ${1, 2, \dots{}, n}$, define

  \(S(a) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_i a_i\).

  The problem is to prove that there exist distinct permutations $b$ and $c$
  such that

  $n!\,\vert{}\,S(b) - S(c)$.

  How would you approach solving this (hard) problem (given that Googling is not

  A famous conjecture (not theorem) states that every even number appears
  infinitely often as a gap between consecutive primes. This statement has not
  been proved --- nor has it been disproved. Even proving that there are
  infinitely many twin primes (gap of 2) remains elusive. Indeed, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKHKD8bRAro&list=PLt5AfwLFPxWJdwkdjaK1ogByEGiVHdEnM][TPC]] is an
  active area of mathematical research, both in finding twins and in attempting
  to prove (or disprove) that they never run out.

  As of September 2016 the pair 2996863034895  \cdot 2^{1290000} \pm 1 holds
  the twin-prime record. Each is a prime with 388,342 digits!

  Here is a statement in first-order (predicate) logic that there are infinitely
  many primes --- as proved by Euclid, recall:

  \(\forall{}q\,\exists{}p\,\forall{}x\,\forall{}y\,[p > q \land ((x > 1 \land y > 1) \rightarrow xy \ne p)]\)

  Add to this statement no more than ten symbols to change it to a statement of
  the TPC, namely, that there is no largest $p$ such that $p$ and $p + 2$ are
  both prime.

  to verify that the above defined sequence contains only composites. Note that
  in a sequence of consecutive numbers, every other one is even, hence
  composite, every third one is a multiple of 3, hence composite, etc. But is
  there a better way to see this than sifting through the sequence looking for
  primes somehow hiding among all those composites? Why or why not?

  A *semiprime* is a composite number with four factors. In other words, it is
  a number that is \ldquo{}almost\rdquo prime, being the product of just two primes, e.g.,
  15 = 3 \cdot 5. (Its other two factors are, of course, one and itself.)

  A *semiprime chain* is a sequence of numbers whose rule is best learned by
  studying some examples:

  15 (3 \cdot 5) links to 23, because 3 is the 2nd prime and 5 is the 3rd prime. This
  is a short chain of length one, just 15, because 23 is prime not semiprime.

  14 (2 \cdot 7) links to 14, because 2 is the 1st prime and 7 is the 4th prime. This
  is a circular chain of length one, just 14.

  22 (2 \cdot 11) links to 15, which links to 23, so 22-15 is a 2-long chain.

  33 (3 \cdot 11) links to 25, which links back to 33, a circular chain of length two.

  Because some semiprimes have a prime factor whose \ldquo{}index\rdquo is greater than 9
  (e.g., 41 is the 13th prime), use this function to reconstitute a number from
  its two prime index \ldquo{}digits\rdquo:

  (defun digits-to-number (d1 d2)

   Euler\rsquo{}s polynomial, x^2 + x + 41, has the /sweet/ feature that it computes a
   prime number for every integer x in the range -40 \le x \le 39, which is 80
   primes total. So, in probability terms, the chances that you will generate a
   prime by plugging in a random integer in that range are 100%. So no chance
   about it, it\rsquo{}s certain!

   Other polynomials of the form f(x) = x^2 + x + C, where C is some integer
   constant, can also generate primes, though maybe not as reliably as Euler\rsquo{}s
   (which is the special case where C = 41). And different ranges and constants
   will vary in the number of primes generated.

   Suppose the /sweetness/ of a given range+constant pair is a quantity such
   that the more integers in the range that generate primes through this
   constant plugged into the polynomial (and taking the absolute value, \vert f(x)
   \vert), the higher the sweetness. So the first example, with range+constant -40 \le
   x \le 39, C = 41, is seemingly pretty sweet, 80 out of 80, 100%, as already
   mentioned. But how many of these 80 are duplicates? Looking closer, it\rsquo{}s
   half. Only 40 unique primes are generated. Not so sweet after all.

   Find a range and constant that have a sweetness value as high as possible,
   subject to the arbitrary constraints that the constant will be between
   negative four million and positive four million. To fix another degree of
   freedom, which will also save some time, use the constant value of ten
   thousand for the /size/ of the range (so only its starting value will vary).
:HINT:
  - Time Hint :: This hard problem is potentially time-consuming.
  - Hint :: Two observations will make the search task faster. First
            observation. x^2 + x is always even, so for adding C and having some
            hope of being prime, C can only be odd. That cuts the possible
            values for C in half!

            Second observation. If you limit your search to the best constant
            for the range 0 to 9999, you can assume you\rsquo{}re not going to do much
            better with a different constant while varying the range. So find
            the best constant first, then see if varying the range can improve
            the sweetness. Realize, too, that any range that straddles the
            origin, i.e, that has both positive and negative x values, will
            produce duplicate primes (why is that?) that will lessen the
            sweetness.

  *Squareful* numbers are positive integers with some factor besides 1
  that is a square (e.g., 4, 9, 16). *Squarefree* numbers are positive
  integers with *no* factors that are squares. (The one exception is 1
  --- by convention, 1 is considered squarefree.) For example, 12 is
  squareful because it has 4 as a factor. 15 is squarefree because
  none of its factors --- 3 and 5 and 15 (remember, don\rsquo{}t count 1) ---
  are squares.
