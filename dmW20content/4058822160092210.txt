  Now that you know how to negate p \rarr q (the conditional operator), write the
  symbolic equivalent of the full quantified expression using the given
  predicates:

  A = is-awesome
  T = is-a-team
  C = is-cool
  D = is-living-dream

* The Proposition In English
   Everything is cool when you\rsquo{}re part of a team (AND)
   Everything is awesome when we\rsquo{}re living our dream.
