#+begin_note
  Henry only has one pair of pants. How many different outfits does Henry have
  if he has 5 long-sleeve shirts and 3 short-sleeve shirts? (An outfit is \ldquo{}pants
  with either a long-sleeve shirt or a short-sleeve shirt\rdquo.)

  If Henry buys another pair of pants and 10 ties, then how many different
  outfits (shirt /and/ tie /and/ pants) will he have?

  Which basic counting principle applies to each scenario?
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Avoid overthinking this exercise, it is very straightforward. In the
            first scenario, the either/or is a very obvious clue.

  \({n \choose k} = {n - 1 \choose k} + {n - 1 \choose k - 1}\).

  This [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#org889e6c7][recurrence relation]] is normally defined for nonnegative $n$ and $k$ ($0 \le
  k \le n$), and to be implemented as a recursive function of two parameters needs
  some \ldquo{}escape hatch\rdquo base cases. Here they are:

  \({n \choose k} = 1\) whenever $k = 0$ or $k = n$;

  whence this straightforward implementation:

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun n-choose-k (n k)
    "Computes C(n, k) by the recursive definition;
  given a pair of nonnegative integers n >= k >= 0,
  returns the value of n choose k."
    (if (or (zerop k) (= k n))
        1
      (+ (n-choose-k (- n 1) (- k 1))
         (n-choose-k (- n 1) k))))
#+end_src

  However, there are good reasons to define other boundary conditions for this
  basic combinatorial function and let its parameters range over all the
  integers.

  \({n \choose k} = 0\) whenever $k < 0$ or $k > n$.

  Explore these reasons, and re-implement =n-choose-k= with =cond= instead of
  =if= to handle these other conditions.

  BTW, the numbers \({n \choose k}\) are known as the [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#orgab2e3d1][binomial coefficients]], and
  for good reason!

  Rather than roll dice, Ruth and Ed usually flip a coin to decide who's going
  to do the chores. One day Ed complains --- he thinks he loses too often. So
  Ruth says, \ldquo{}OK, this time you flip two coins, and I flip one. If you get more
  heads than I do, I\rsquo{}ll clean the toilets.\rdquo Ed likes Ruth\rsquo{}s display of
  generosity and says, \ldquo{}You\rsquo{}re on!\rdquo

  What are his chances?

  A standard 52-card deck has 4 suits [\heartsuit \spadesuit \diamondsuit \clubsuit] of 13 cards each. A 5-card
  hand can be chosen in any of \({52 \choose 5}\) ways. Bridge is a game where
  each of 4 players is dealt 13 cards, which means the whole deck is dealt. A
  hand has a distribution of suits, which is how many of each suit make up the
  13 total. For example, =[2 2 3 6]= is the suit distribution of the hand
  [Ace\heartsuit 3\hearts 2\diamondsuit{} 9\diamondsuit 4\clubsuit 2\clubsuit 7\clubsuit Jack\spadesuit 9\spadesuit 5\spadesuit Queen\spadesuit 10\spadesuit 6\spadesuit] (2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 3
  clubs and 6 spades).

  How many different hands with a =[4 4 3 2]= suit distribution can be dealt?

  How many different suit distributions are there? (=[4 4 3 2]= is /not/
  different than =[2 3 4 4]=, because order of the suits does /not/ matter.)

  In the game of /Five Crowns/ there are 116 cards in two combined decks, and in
  each of 11 hands the number of cards dealt each player increases by one,
  starting at 3, ending at 13. This implies 11 different numbers of total
  possible hands from randomly shuffled decks. At which hand (/n/ between 3
  and 13) will it become infeasible to compute this number of possible hands
  without overflowing the capacity of an elisp /fixnum/?

#+begin_note
  What is the probability that a randomly chosen 3-digit number unambiguously
  designates a date (month number plus day number paired without punctuation)?
  E.g., 111 is ambiguous, it could mean January 11th (month 1, day 11) or
  November 1st (month 11, day 1). Don\rsquo{}t count numbers with zeros in the second
  or third position (why not the first position?) as ambiguous, given the rule
  that days are never written with a leading zero. E.g., 101 can only mean
  October 1st, not January 1st. Eliminate from the event space any invalid
  numbers, e.g. 345, as neither 3/45 nor 34/5 is a valid date.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Concretize! List all the 3-digit numbers from 100 to 999 and divide
            them into two sets: valid and invalid.
