   The goal of this CDL is to help clarify the difference between exercises and
   problems in the contexts of numbers and words.

* Numbers
** An Exercise
   Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with height 3 and base 11.

** Extend An Exercise into a Problem
   Create two rectangles so that the first has a bigger perimeter, and the
   second a bigger area.

** Take It To The Next Level
   Create two rectangles so that the first has exactly twice the perimeter of
   the second, and the second has exactly twice the area of the first.
* Words
** Another Six Times Three

    ABU \rarr Atticus Bernhold Ushnol
    ILA \rarr Ila
    ENT \rarr Elementary Number Theory
    RSA \rarr (Ron) Rivest (Adi) Shamir (Leonard) Adleman
    CRT \rarr Chinese Remainder Theorem
** Four Times Four
*** Not a Word
     ABCDLMNOOSARSICD is just 16 letters concatenated together.
**** But divide and stack it
     ABCD
     LMNO
     OSAR
     SICD
***** and what does it mean?
****** TODO Think about it and write your thoughts:
*** Another Non-Word
    but closer: TETRAGRAMAMALGAM

    TETR
    AGRA
    MAMA
    LGAM

    If we define Word Search Density (WSD) appropriately, the above would have a
    WSD of 2/20 = 0.1 -- not great.

**** TODO Write a definition of WSD
***** Use Only Common Words
 #+begin_src elisp
   (symbol-value (require 'common-words))
 #+end_src

****** TODO With this constraint write another WSD definition
*** TODO Look For Better
    Find a 16-letter word that when stacked has a bigger than 0.1 WSD.

    Is this an exercise or a problem?
