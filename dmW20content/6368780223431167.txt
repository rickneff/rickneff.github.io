  Help Abu and Ila out. This version of =mod-expt= gets a /little/ better
  mileage than their simplistic one. It keeps the numbers smaller by reducing
  each partial exponentiation by modding it once every iteration instead of once,
  period. What fact or facts of modular arithmetic justify this?

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun a-better-mod-expt (base power modulus)
    (loop with result = 1
          for n from 1 to power
          do (setq result (mod (* result base) modulus))
          finally return result))

  Experiment with RSA using the following code. You will need a better modular
  exponentiation function than =mod-expt= or perhaps even =a-better-mod-expt=.
  Implement the =pow-mod= function to be this better version. Note the
  difference between /encoding/ and /encryption/, and between /decryption/ and
  /decoding/.

  How \ldquo{}big\rdquo a message can you successfully round-trip?

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun rsa-encrypt (message n e &optional encoder)
    (let* ((message-encoded (funcall (or encoder 'identity) message))
           (encrypted (pow-mod message-encoded e n)))
      encrypted))

  (defun rsa-decrypt (encrypted n d &optional decoder)
    (let* ((decrypted (pow-mod encrypted d n))
           (message-decoded (funcall (or decoder 'identity) decrypted)))
      message-decoded))

  (defun round-trip (message n e d &optional encoder decoder)
    (equal message
           (rsa-decrypt (rsa-encrypt message n e encoder)
                        n d decoder)))

  You will need working =from-base-27= and =to-base-27= functions, as well as a
  working knowledge of /symbol property lists/ to play with /this/ test code:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun test-rsa (message-with-spaces)
    (let* ((message (mapconcat 'identity
                               (split-string message-with-spaces " ") "@"))
            (n (get 'rsa-players :n))
            (e (get 'rsa-players :e))
            (d (get 'rsa-players :d))
            (encrypted (rsa-encrypt message n e 'from-base-27))
            (decrypted (rsa-decrypt encrypted n d 'to-base-27))
            (decrypted-message-with-spaces
             (mapconcat 'identity (split-string decrypted "@") " "))
            (success (string= message-with-spaces
                              decrypted-message-with-spaces)))
       (princ (format (concat "\"%s\"\nwas encoded and encrypted as\n%s\n"
                              "then decrypted and decoded as\n\"%s\"\n")
                      message-with-spaces
                      encrypted
                      decrypted-message-with-spaces))
       (princ (if success "" "un"))
       (princ "successfully.\n")

   Space-Time Tradeoff

   The vector named first-ten-million-primes is created when loading the
   \ldquo{}first-ten-million-primes\rdquo package. That consists of 10,000,000 primes
   hardwired into an 89 Mbyte file! (It is problematic to load this source
   file into emacs, but loading the package does not require this.)

   The question to explore: Would it be faster to use an efficient Sieve of
   Eratosthenes and just create this vector on the fly?

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun sieve (limit)
    "Sieve of Eratothenes."
    (let ((prime-vec (make-bool-vector limit t)))
      (aset prime-vec 0 nil) ;; zero is not prime
      (aset prime-vec 1 nil) ;; nor is one
      (loop for p from 2 to (floor (sqrt limit))
            when (aref prime-vec p) ;; when p is prime
            do (loop for i from (* p p) below limit by p
                     do (aset prime-vec i nil)))

   Implement in elisp Pollard\rsquo{}s Rho method of factorization (see bigal.jar
   (generated by the "bigal" package)). Compare it with the simplistic
   trial-division =factorize= function in the =ment= package.
