  Now that you know a few proof basics, here is a chance to apply them:

* A Tale of Two Proofs
** TODO Simple Proof Problem
    Prove that if two whole numbers are mutually divisible they must be the same number.

    That is, if a divides b and b divides a then a = b.
:HINT:
  Use the definition: r | s means \exist{}x rx = s.
:END:
:ALSO:
  Use the fact that equals multiplied by equals are equal!
:END:
** TODO Harder Proof Problem
   In the form of a multiple choice question:

   For which y, for all integers x > 1, is x^y + y never a prime?
   - [ ] 2
   - [ ] 3
   - [ ] 4
   - [ ] 5
   - [ ] It cannot be determined.
