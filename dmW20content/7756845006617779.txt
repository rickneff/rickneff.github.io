* What\rsquo{}s It All About?
  This course is about the *theory of computation.*

  The following is a partial list of topics that will be covered:

  - Finite Automata
  - Regular Expressions
  - Languages
  - Grammars
  - Turing Machines
  - Computability
  - Complexity
  - P, NP and NP-Complete Problems.

* Outcomes
 1. Examine the theoretical basis of computer science.
 2. Learn the real limitations and opportunities in computing. This includes:
    - What can and can not be computed (computability),
    - The power of different types of computational systems in terms of what they
      can compute (automata classification, recursive function theory, Chomsky
      Hierarchy),
    - What is practically computable and the complexity of solving certain
      classes of problems (complexity and tractability).
 3. Appreciate and gain proficiency with rigorous methods, representations, and
    proof techniques.
 4. Learn how to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

* Prerequisites
  You must have successfully completed the following courses:

  - CS 238 Discrete Mathematics II (concurrent enrollment okay)
  - CS 306 Algorithms and Complexity

* Requirements
** Required Text

** Required Software
   For the first two, see installation instructions [[https://rickneff.github.io][here]] and go to the /Tools/
   section.
   + git
   + Emacs/Spacemacs
   + python3
   + Jove

  [[file:~/Jove/README.md]]

** Required Accounts
   You are required to have an account using your real name and school email
   address with (at least) these three platforms:
   + https://github.com
   + https://quizlet.com
   + https://zoom.us

** Required Behaviors
  You are required to:
  + attend class, as assessments will happen in class each day that are not
    reproducible outside of class;
  + read assigned portions of the course materials /before/ class each Monday;
  + complete all team and personal assessments to deepen your understanding of
    selected topics; and
  + bring a laptop or other Internet-connectable (and tools-ready) device to
    each class meeting.
  + maintain a portfolio of your completed work (see below).
  + complete an initial and a final take-home exam.

* Course Periodicity
  This course has a weekly period, i.e., you can count on knowing ahead of time
  what you will be doing each day of each week. Each class meeting consists of two
  types of activity:

** Mondays
  - Presentation :: --- A time where I will add depth information to the preparation
                    material you finished reading *before class*.
  - Class Directed Learning :: --- You will participate in a class-wide activity that
       reinforces what you\rsquo{}ve read and what I\rsquo{}ve shown you.

** Wednesdays
  - Readiness Assessment :: --- A short in-class quiz on the reading and topics
       for the week.
  - Answer Questions :: --- I will answer questions that have surfaced through
       various means, including the quiz you will have just taken.

** Fridays
   - Work Day :: --- We will meet in class and help each other finish the week\rsquo{}s
                 work.

* Questions
  + Some of the questions answered on Wednesdays are verbatim or generalized from
    those you create and make available through to-be-determined means.
  + Creating questions helps you develop higher order thinking skills.
  + You will have plenty of questions. Engage with them! Choose knowledge over
    ignorance.

* Work
** Exercises
   Exercises are smaller experiences that are designed to float uncertainties and
   questions you have to the surface of your mind. They are designed to be smaller
   so you can find out what you don\rsquo{}t know and then take the steps necessary to
   know.

** Problems
   Problems are weightier experiences that invite you to explore topics in
   theoretical computer science --- and especially mathematical proofs --- as
   well as increase your logical thinking and problem solving prowess. All
   involve writing mathematically (see [[file:org-mode-primer.txt][org-mode-primer.txt]]).

   As a refresher, [[https://rickneff.github.io/exercises-versus-problems.html][here is a description of the difference]] between Exercises and
   Problems.

* Assessment
  About every four weeks you will meet with me in my office. The purpose of this
  meeting is for you to present your portfolio of work to me, make a
  grade-to-date claim, and provide evidence justifying that claim.

  Your portfolio *MUST* be a modified version of this file, and those included by
  it. All entries must follow the example format you will find at the end of
  this file. Also, your evidences must be complete and internally consistent.
  You are required to produce your portfolio using Spacemacs, and you *MUST* be
  able to successfully export it as an HTML file (see the link at the top of
  this file).

* Grades
  In each of our three personal meetings, you will present your portfolio and a
  letter-based grade-to-date claim. Afterwards I will give you my thoughts on
  the strength of your claim. The last claim that you make (*not an average* of
  the three), taking into account any feedback from me, will be your final grade
  for the course. All of your claims must must be evidence-based. That means you
  *MUST* bring the evidence with you, in your portfolio, that supports your
  claim.

** Letter-Based
   When making your claim, you are required to use the [[http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system][BYU-Idaho standard]]
   letter-based definition of grades, reproduced below. *Note with one exception
   that there are no plusses or minuses!*

   + \ldquo{}A\rdquo represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
     subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use
     of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems.
     Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including
     initiative in serving other students.
   + \ldquo{}B\rdquo represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
     incorporation of the material that would prepare a student to be successful
     in next level courses, graduate school, or employment. The student
     participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
   + \ldquo{}C\rdquo represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
     demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
     could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging.
     The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
   + \ldquo{}D\rdquo represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
     apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary
     to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
   + \ldquo{}D-\rdquo represents failure in the course. [[https://rickneff.github.io/why-not-f.html][Why not F?]]

   Note that the above description of an \ldquo{}A\rdquo implies that you have gone *above
   and beyond*. To claim this grade you *must* have done and recorded evidence
   in your portfolio of doing *some* of the behaviors listed below, *each week*
   throughout each 4-week period.
   1. teaching a Non-CS, Non-CE, Non-EE, Non-SE major about the material in
      this class to help them with a class they are taking
   2. applying what you\rsquo{}ve learned in this class in another class you are
      currently taking
   3. posing thoughtful questions
   4. doing other work not assigned, exploring other topics in mathematics,
      writing code implementing what you are learning that has not been
      assigned, etc.

   How many is *some*? It is doing at least one of the first two (1, 2),
   *and* at least one of the last two (3, 4).

   Regarding teaching others, quoting Truman Madsen (quoting the Prophet Joseph
   Smith): Now one of the strongest and wisest statements I have ever heard on
   egoism. The question was put to him, \ldquo{}Joseph, is the principle of
   self-aggrandizement wrong? Should we seek our own good?\rdquo Listen to his
   answer. \ldquo{}It is a correct principle and may be indulged upon only one rule or
   plan --- and that is to elevate, benefit, and bless others first. If you will
   elevate others, the very work itself will exalt you. Upon no other plan can a
   man justly and permanently aggrandize himself.\rdquo
* Moral/Legal
** Honor Code
   + [[http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/HJPtItSal?bc=true&bcCurrent=Academic%2520Honesty&bcGroup=University%2520Standards&bcItemType=policies][Academic Honesty]]

     Quoting from the latter:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Men are expected to be clean-shaven; beards are not acceptable.
#+END_QUOTE
  Regarding the celebrated [[https://byuiscroll.org/beard-card-used-abused/][beard card]]:
  1. Students who are requesting a first-time shaving exemption will be
     required to attend a seminar led by Student Honor Office administrators.
  2. All students who are seeking a shaving exemption, whether it’s a first
     time or a renewal exemption for the new semester, will have a one on one
     meeting with a Student Honor administrator to discuss the policy,
     expectations, and to sign a new commitment to abide by the standard as
     close as medically possible (i.e. no lumberjack beards).
  3. Students who are granted a shaving exemption will receive a printed card.
  4. Faculty members will be notified by the Student Honor Office through
     email when a student registered in their class receives a shaving
     exemption.
  5. All shaving exemptions are granted for no more than one semester and
     expire at the end of each semester.
  6. There will be a short grace period during the first week or two of the
     semester in order to give time for the Student Honor Office to process
     new requests.
  7. After that grace period, if you are not meeting the standard, and we have
     a conversation about it, and if it continues to be a problem, I will
     refer you to the Student Honor Office, which you must visit with before
     returning to class --- either clean-shaven or with a card.
