* TODO Explore and Wonder
  The goal of today\rsquo{}s CDL is to complete four tasks:

  - [ ] Install graphviz.
  - [ ] Explore the dot language and elisp/org-mode/dot interaction.
  - [ ] Decode the message in the graph (picture 3). Be sure to trace the link
        arrows correctly (some of which overlap and partially coincide on the
        bottom row).
  - [ ] Figure out how to draw the link arrows without overlapping each other or
        crossing through the node circles.
