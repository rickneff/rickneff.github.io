* TODO Supply and Test
  The only function definition missing from the code block in
  file:presentation-12.txt is =distance=.

  Supply this missing function so that you can evaluate the following block to
  test this =TSP-solver=:

#+begin_src elisp :results raw
  (setq cities-coords-20 (build-cities-coords 20 900 600 "twentysomething")
        cities-coords (subseq cities-coords-20 0 9) ;; change 9 to a smaller integer (> 3) to save time
        start (float-time)
        results (TSP-solver (build-distance-matrix cities-coords))
        timed-results (cons (- (float-time) start) results))
#+end_src

* TODO Heed Hint
  You may find this python code helpful:

#+begin_src python :results output
  from math import sqrt

  class City:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
      self.x = x
      self.y = y

  def distance(c1, c2):
    return sqrt((c1.x - c2.x)**2 + (c1.y - c2.y)**2)

  print distance(City(300, 270), City(450, 109))
#+end_src

  This code, borrowed from Norvig\rsquo{}s pytude, may also come in handy:
#+begin_src python :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def plot_tour(tour):
      "Plot the cities as circles and the tour as lines between them."
      plot_lines(list(tour) + [tour[0]])

  def plot_lines(points, style='bo-'):
      "Plot lines to connect a series of points."
      plt.plot([p.real for p in points], [p.imag for p in points], style)
      plt.axis('scaled')
      plt.axis('off')

  plot_tour(((6+546j),
   (199+147j),
   (350+65j),
   (737+26j),
   (847+187j),
   (891+465j),
   (554+374j),
   (505+548j)))

  plt.savefig('pyplot-tour.png')
  return 'pyplot-tour.png'
#+end_src

#+results:
[[file:pyplot-tour.png]]

** TODO Enjoy a Bonus!
   Graphics are always good for helping us visualize problem results. The bonus
   is found in the interaction between org-mode-enabled elisp code and python
   code!

#+name: points-to-plot
#+begin_src elisp :results value
  (setq winning-tour (cdr results)
        coords (mapcar (lambda (i)
                         (let ((city (nth (1- i) cities-coords)))
                           (list (car city) (cdr city))))
                        winning-tour))
#+end_src

  In the table produced by evaluating the above code block, notice that
  \ldquo{}#+results\rdquo is followed by the name \ldquo{}points-to-plot\rdquo --- which being so named
  means that evaluating the following code block will work.

#+begin_src python :var pts=points-to-plot :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def plot_tour(tour):
      "Plot the cities as circles and the tour as lines between them."
      plot_lines(tour + [tour[0]])

  def plot_lines(points, style='bo-'):
      "Plot lines to connect a series of points."
      plt.plot([p[0] for p in points], [p[1] for p in points], style)

  plot_tour(pts)
  plt.savefig('pyplot-tour.png')
  return 'pyplot-tour.png'
#+end_src

** TODO Go above and beyond
  To show you *really understand* this brute-force algorithm, write four new
  functions corresponding to the four steps outlined in
  file:presentation-12.txt, such that the following code block will evaluate:

#+begin_src elisp :results raw
  (setq distance-matrix (build-distance-matrix cities-coords)
        step-1-results (produce-every-permutation-of-cities distance-matrix)
        step-2-results (create-circuit-for-each-permutation step-1-results)
        step-3-results (calculate-circuit-distances step-2-results step-1-results)
        step-4-results (find-circuit-with-shortest-distance step-3-results))
#+end_src

  All the code you need is found in the =TSP-solver= function. You only need to
  reorganize it!
