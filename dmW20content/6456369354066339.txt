  This is largely a team-guided learning exercise. You may not finish in the
  remaining class time, but be sure to check with each other that you *DID*
  finish.

* Tasks
** TODO Tour
   If needed/desired, take a tour of Google's colab from
   https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#
   focusing on the manner in which you enter code and text.
** TODO Setup
   Find at our class Teams page and read the document where Scott helpfully put
   instructions on how to set up and begin using colab, and in particular, Jove
   within colab.
** TODO Browse
   On the colab branch, browse the content and come to the Jupyter ipynb
   notebook called ClassMaterial/2020/Assignments/Asg-1/Asg-1.ipynb
** TODO Run
   Execute all the cells in that notebook. (Note you can be lazy and do a
   \ldquo{}Restart and run all\rdquo under \ldquo{}Runtime\rdquo.)
* Reflection
   Even though this is a team-guided learning exercise, answer honestly and
   individually:

   Did you run and understand each and every execution?
