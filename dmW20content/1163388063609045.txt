* TODO Explore and Wonder
  With only whiteboard and markers, explore a (very insecure --- why?) cast of
  RSA players. Brother Neff will compute hard exponentiations for you on
  request. You must do all other calculations by hand. (For TUMMIs, find what
  multiple of e is one more than a multiple of t.)

  Using p = 3 and q = 13, compute all values of c when m = 10 and e ranges from
  smallest to largest. In other words, encrypt m several different ways, each
  way using a different e, for all possible e values less than the totient of p
  and q.

  Find the corresponding d for each e and verify that 10 is the value you get
  when you decrypt each c with that d.

  Notice something interesting about the e's and the d's?!

  Is this a feature or a bug in RSA?
