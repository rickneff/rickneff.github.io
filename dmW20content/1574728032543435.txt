  First recall (or look up) how the =&rest= keyword works, e.g.:

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun printf (format-directive &rest args)
    (princ (apply 'format format-directive args)))
#+end_src

  Now explain what this code does after trying it on a few tests:

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun mystery (&rest numbers)
    (loop for n from 0 to (apply '* numbers)
          do (printf "%3d <--> %s\n" n
                     (loop for m in numbers collect (mod n m)))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp :results output
  (mystery 3 5)
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp :results output
  (mystery 4 6)
#+end_src

  Replace ='*= with ='lcm= and do the same calls again. Explain what you
  observed, and come up with a better name for the =mystery= function.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: In your source code blocks, use the header directive =:results

  Replace the =;;...= line with three lines, binding the values of =y1=, =y2= and
  =y3=. Write a helper function to compute these values.

#+begin_src elisp
  (let* ((r1 4)
         (r2 2)
         (r3 9)
         (m1 7)

         (m3 13)
         (m (* m1 m2 m3))
         (o1 (/ m m1))
         (o2 (/ m m2))
         (o3 (/ m m3))
         ;;...
         )
    (mod (+ (* r1 o1 y1) (* r2 o2 y2) (* r3 o3 y3)) m))
#+end_src
:HINT:
  - Hint :: The y\rsquo{}s are just the MMIs of the o\rsquo{}s mod the m\rsquo{}s. The helper
            function should use the Extended Euclidean GCD algorithm to compute
            these MMIs.

  If p and q are coprime positive integers, then does a bijection necessarily
  exist between $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q}$?

  Explain what the following code does, and how:
#+begin_src elisp
  (let* ((p 3)
         (q 5)
         (z-pq (number-sequence 0 (* p q))))
      (mapcar* 'list z-pq
               (mapcar (lambda (n) (mod n p)) z-pq)
               (mapcar (lambda (n) (mod n q)) z-pq)))
#+end_src

  Imagine the above code were wrapped in a function definition with p and q
  passed as parameters instead of bound in the =let=, then compare this function
  to the =mystery= function. Which function would be more in the functional
  programming style?

#+begin_note
  The Chinese Remainder Theorem makes possible the use of a /residue number
  system/ to do computer arithmetic with \ldquo{}large\rdquo integers, where largeness is
  relative. Large in practice means numbers with hundreds or thousands of
  digits. For this problem, large means no greater than 1000. Normally,
  arithmetic with numbers in this range would be trivial, but the normal
  arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication are to be
  viewed as quite expensive. You must find ways to avoid using them.
  Exponentially more expensive are the division and modulus operations --- avoid
  these especially!

  Use the code below as a guide and a starting point, finish implementing the
  =to-rns=, =from-rns=, =add2= and =mul2= functions, and then in separate code
  blocks, write test code that can correctly add and multiply one-, two-, and
  three-digit nonnegative integers, converting to rns, doing the rns operations,
  then converting back from rns.

  /Avoid at all costs/ the use of =+=, =-=, =*=, =/=, =%=, or =mod=!

  You will benefit greatly if you write helper functions and use good functional
  programming style throughout.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun to-rns (n)
    "Convert a normal integer between 0 and 1000 to its rns modulo
    1001 representation."
    )

  (defun from-rns (rns)
    "Convert from an rns modulo 1001 integer back to its normal
    representation."
    )

  (defun add2 (rns1 rns2)
    "Add two rns modulo 1001 integers to produce their rns sum."
    )

  (defun mul2 (rns1 rns2)
    "Multiply two rns modulo 1001 integers to produce their rns
    product."
    )
#+end_src

  The rest of the code is good as is. Note the mention in the documentation of
  the $\mathbb{Z}_7$, $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ residue sets. Recall
  that a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ residue set is just the possible remainders when modding
  by n, i.e., [0 1 2 3 \dots n-1].

   sum to the same number as the last three digits. For example, the following
