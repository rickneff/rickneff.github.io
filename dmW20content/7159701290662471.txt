* Problem Statement With Variables
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A census-taker knocks on the door and a woman answers the door. She tells the
  census-taker that she lives in the house with her =nd= daughters.

  \ldquo{}And what are their ages?\rdquo the census-taker asked.

  \ldquo{}I won\rsquo{}t tell you --- but I will tell you that =pa= is the product of their
  ages\rdquo, replied the woman.

  \ldquo{}That\rsquo{}s not enough information\rdquo, said the census-taker.

  \ldquo{}Okay, the sum of their ages is =sa=\rdquo, said the woman.

  \ldquo{}That\rsquo{}s still not enough information! Please, is there something more you can
  tell me?\rdquo the census-taker implored.

  \ldquo{}Yes, there is. =sm=\rdquo, revealed the woman.
