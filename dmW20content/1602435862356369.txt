* Empirical Induction versus Mathematical Induction
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Will the sun rise on January 1 next year? There is no way to be absolutely sure.
  It is always possible that the world will end before then by divine decree or by
  some natural calamity. ... The most we can say is that it is an excellent bet
  that on the next New Year\rsquo{}s day, the sun will rise as usual. Our jump from a
  finite set of past sunrises to an infinite future set, or at least to a future
  set with a large number of elements, is an empirical induction.

  Mathematicians have an analogous technique known as mathematical induction or
  complete induction that also supports a jump from a finite set of cases to a
  larger or an infinite number of cases. Unlike empirical induction, the
  mathematical technique is entirely deductive. A \ldquo{}jump proof\rdquo, as it is sometimes
  called, is as certain as any proof can be in mathematics.

  To prove something by mathematical induction we must first have a series of
  statements (usually an infinite series but not necessarily so) that can be put
  into a one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers. Second, we must
  establish that the statements are related to one another by ... the \ldquo{}hereditary
  property\rdquo. If any statement is true, its successor --- the \ldquo{}next\rdquo statement ---
  is true. Third, we must show that the first statement is true. It then follows
  with iron certainty that all the statements are true.

  Jump proofs have been likened to a row of bricks or dominoes that are standing
  on end and all topple over when you unbalance the first one. [It\rsquo{}s like] a pile
  of envelopes, each containing a note that says: \ldquo{}Open the next envelope, read
  the order and carry it out.\rdquo If you are committed to obeying the order in the
  first envelope, you must open all the envelopes and obey all the orders.

* The Principle of Mathematical Induction
  Verbose version:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
  IF a proposition involving the positive integer N
     can be proven to have the two properties:

     1) The proposition is true for N = 1, and

     2) IF K is any value of N
          for which the proposition is true
        THEN the proposition is also true
          for the next value N = K + 1;
  THEN the proposition is true
    for all positive integral values of N.
#+END_VERSE
** Succinct version
   [P(1) \land \forall k(P(k) \rightarrow P(k + 1))] \rightarrow \forall nP(n)

* Classic Example
  Use mathematical induction to prove that the sum
  of the first /n/ odd positive integers is /n^2/.

  Let /P(n)/ be the proposition \(\sum_{j=1}^n (2j - 1) = n^2\)

  *Basis Step:* /P(1)/ is true since \(2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 = 1^2\)

  *Inductive Step:* Assume /P(k)/ is true, that is

  \(\sum_{j=1}^k (2j - 1) = k^2,\) so then \(\sum_{j=1}^{k}(2j - 1) =
  2 \cdot 1 - 1 + 2 \cdot 2 - 1 + \ldots + 2 \cdot k - 1\)

  and to show /P(k)/ \rightarrow /P(k + 1)/ (which completes the proof):
  \[
  \begin{array}{lll}
  \sum_{j=1}^{k + 1}(2j - 1)&=&\sum_{j=1}^k(2j - 1) + 2(k + 1) - 1\\
  &=& k^2 + 2(k + 1) - 1\\
  &=& k^2 + 2k + 2 - 1\\
  &=& k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\\
  \end{array}\]
  QED

* Another Example (with a \ldquo{}non-one\rdquo basis step)
  Let P(n) be 2^n > n^2. Prove \forall{}n > 4 P(n).

  *Basis Step:* P(5) is true since 2^5 = 32 > 25 = 5^2

  *Inductive Step:* Assume P(k) is true, that is 2^k > k^2.
  Then,
  \[\begin{array}{rll}
  2^{k+1} &=& 2 \cdot 2^k\\
  & & \\
  &>& k^2 + k^2\\
  & & \\
  &>& k^2 + 4k\ \mbox{(since k > 4)}\\
  & & \\
  &>& k^2 + 2k + 1\\
  & & \\
  &=& (k + 1)^2.\\
  \end{array}
  \]
  QED

Question: Which step above used 2^k > k^2 (the inductive hypothesis)?

* Yet Another One
  Let P(n) be the statement that n! < n^n, where n \in Z^{+}, n > 1.

  What is the statement P(2)?

  Just plug in n = 2: P(2) is the statement 2! < 2^2.

  Show that P(2) is true, completing the basis step of the proof.

  Since 2! = 2 and 2^2 = 4, this is the true statement 2 < 4.

  What is the inductive hypothesis? It is the statement k! < k^k.

  What do you need to prove in the inductive step?

  You need to prove that for each k \ge 2 that P(k) implies
  P(k + 1).  In other words, show that assuming the inductive
  hypothesis (k! < k^k) you can prove that (k + 1)! < (k + 1)^{k + 1}.

  Complete the inductive step.

  \((k + 1)! = (k + 1)k! < (k + 1)k^k < (k + 1)(k + 1)^k = (k + 1)^{k + 1}\)

  Having completed both the basis step and the inductive step, by the
  PMI, the statement is true for every n \in Z^{+}, n > 1.

  QED

* Still Yet Another One

  Find a formula for \(\frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3} +
  \cdots + \frac{1}{n(n + 1)}\) by examining the values of this
  expression for small values of n.

  By computing the first few sums and getting the answers 1/2, 2/3,
  and 3/4, it\rsquo{}s easy to guess that the sum is \(n/(n + 1)\).

  Prove this formula works for all n \in Z^{+} using the PMI.

  *BASE:* It is true for n = 1, since there is just one term, 1/2.

  *IHOP:* Suppose that \(\frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3} + \cdots +
  \frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \frac{k}{k + 1}\)

  *GOAL:* You must now show that \[\left[
  \frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k(k +
  1)}\right] + \frac{1}{(k + 1)(k + 2)} = \frac{k + 1}{k + 2}\]

  Use the IHOP and do the algebra, reaching the desired expression:

  \(\frac{k}{k + 1} + \frac{1}{(k + 1)(k + 2)} = \frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{(k + 1)(k + 2)} = \frac{k + 1}{k + 2}\)

  QED

* Even Still Yet Another One
  Let P(n) be 2^n > n^4. (Or, n^4 < 2^n.)

  Prove \forall n>16 P(n).

  *Basis step:* P(17) is true since 2^{17} = 131072 > 83521 = 17^4.

  *Inductive step:*

  Assume P(j) is true.

  (Note the switch to using j rather than k --- the point being that it
  doesn\rsquo{}t matter what variable name you use.)

  Then it follows that \[\begin{array}{rll}(j + 1)^4 &=& j^4 + 4j^3 + 6j^2 + 4j + 1\\
  &<& j^4 + 4j^3 + 6j^3 + 4j^3 + 2j^3\\
  &=& j^4 + 16j^3\\
  &<& j^4 + j^4\ (\mbox{since}\ 16 < j)\\
  &=& 2j^4\\
  &<& 2 \cdot 2^j\ \mbox{(by the inductive hypothesis)}\\
  &=& 2^{j+1},\ \mbox{as desired}.\end{array}\]
  QED

  You should be able to generalize this to prove that \(\exists k\ \forall p\ \forall n>k\ (2^n > n^p).\)

* More Fermat\rsquo{}s Little Theorem
  You encountered Fermat\rsquo{}s Little Theorem (hereafter FLT) last week in the
  context of probabilistic primality testing, and it also features in Assignment
  07\rsquo{}s first TODO.

  Let us prove this highly important number-theoretic fact using mathematical
  induction:

  FLT: If N is prime, and X is any integer, then N divides X^N - X.
** Proof By Induction on X
  1. When X = 0, the theorem says that N divides 0, which is clearly true.
  2. Suppose it holds for X (inductive hypothesis).
  3. Then the remainder when N goes into X^N is X (which is what the theorem
     says, restated).
  4. What is the remainder when N goes into (X + 1)^N? (It should be (X + 1) for
     the inductive argument to work.)
  5. Let\rsquo{}s see by expanding (X + 1)^N:
  6. (X + 1)^N = X^N + (N choose N - 1)X^{N - 1} + (N choose N - 2)X^{N - 2} + \cdots +
     (N choose 1)X + 1.
  7. In terms of division by N, the (N choose k) terms can\rsquo{}t matter, since N
     divides (N choose k).
  8. So the remainder is the same as when N goes into X^N + 1, and therefore it\rsquo{}s
     (X + 1).
  9. QED
** Equivalently
   FLT is also stated: X^{p - 1} \equiv_p 1, if p is prime and does not divide X.

   This version suggests that a way you can find the inverse of X (mod p) is by
   calculating X^{p - 2} (mod p), because X \cdot X^{p - 2} = X^{p - 1} which is \equiv_p 1 by FLT.
