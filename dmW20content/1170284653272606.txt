  Based on what you learned from file:presentation-09.txt and your reading of
  Chapter 14:

* TODO Explain Three Ways
  of doing the same computation:
  1.
: >>> simulateTM(rf(’containsGAGA.tm’), ’TTGAGATT’)
  2.
: >>> containsGAGA(’TTGAGATT’)
  3.
: >>> universal(rf(’containsGAGA.py’), ’TTGAGATT’)

  Explain what you think each does.

  What is the difference between the above three methods of doing
  the same computation?

* TODO Explain Your Understanding
  What do the following produce, and why?
#+begin_src python
  from utils import rf, ESS
  from alter import alterGAGAtoTATA

  return alterGAGAtoTATA(ESS(rf('repeatCAorGA.py'), 'CA'))
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  from utils import rf, ESS
  from alter import alterGAGAtoTATA

  return alterGAGAtoTATA(ESS(rf('repeatCAorGA.py'), 'GA'))
#+end_src

* TODO Explain Further
  Why does the =recYesOnString= program not also *decide* =YesOnString=?
