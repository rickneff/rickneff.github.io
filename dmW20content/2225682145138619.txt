** TODO KDB *
#+begin_note
  List in lisp form all the simple paths (in both representations) from =MT= to
  =NM=, identifying the shortest path(s) and the longest path(s).

** TODO ABR *
#+begin_note
  Directed graphs (/digraphs/ for short) can represent binary relations. Make a
  connection between the four relation types and the existence or non-existence
  of certain features in the graph of the relation.

  - Reflexive = /every/ node has a link that is a loop.
  - Symmetric = there are /no/ single link arrows (one-way trips) --- every link
    arrow is a double one (roundtrip).
  - Antisymmetric = there is /no/ double arrow (going both ways) /unless/ it is
    a loop.
  - Transitive = there is /no/ two-leg journey (think flight with a layover)
    without a shortcut (non-stop flight).

  It is helpful to draw a graph of a relation that is described more abstractly.
  For an example of an abstract description, here is the relation on the set [1
  2 3] given by this vector of \ldquo{}conses\rdquo (another way to say /dotted pairs/)
  representing the ordered pairs:

  [(1 . 1) (1 . 2) (2 . 2) (3 . 3)]

  The three-node four-link graph of that relation appears in [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-org53bfa2d][section VWF]].

  Identify which features listed above this graph has. Draw the digraphs of some
  other abstract binary relations, with and without the four features.

** TODO HRR
#+begin_note
  In another multigraph example, what is the connection between [the \ldquo{}four nodes
  seven links\rdquo] graph and the \ldquo{}birth of graph theory\rdquo?

  What do its nodes and links represent? What is its degree sequence?

  Explore the graph property \ldquo{}Eulerian\rdquo. Does this graph have it? Describe
  necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian.

* Puzzles
  No puzzles again this week. Work on GPAOs instead! (If you have finished all
  those seen so far, pick one from the endnotes of the book, and describe what
  you did with it.)
