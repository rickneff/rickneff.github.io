* Huffman Trees are Scary Cool
** Data Compression
   Let\rsquo{}s talk about compressing data and how to do it with Huffman Trees and
   Huffman encoding and decoding.
** Tasks
  - [ ] Build a Huffman tree for a simple message.
  - [ ] Encode it.
  - [ ] Compute the average number of bits per character with this encoding.
  - [ ] Compute the compression ratio.
  - [ ] Decode an encoded message with the same tree.
