* Beyond Conjecture Verifying
  --- go directly to a Proof!
** Preliminary Considerations

     Let $A = \{ \lfloor n\sqrt{2} \rfloor : n \in {\mathbf Z^+} \}$, and let $B = \{ \lfloor n(2 +
     \sqrt{2}) \rfloor : n \in {\mathbf Z^+} \}$:

    \(\begin{array}{|c|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
    \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  n & {\mathbf 1} & {\mathbf 2} & {\mathbf 3} & {\mathbf 4} & {\mathbf 5} & {\mathbf 6} & {\mathbf 7} & {\mathbf 8} & {\mathbf 9} & {\mathbf 10} & \ldots\\ \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  A & 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 11 & 12 & 14 &\ldots \\
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\  \hline
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\
  B & 3 & 6 & 10 & 13 & 17 & 20 & 23 & 27 & 30 & 34 &\ldots \\
    & & & & & & & & & & &\\ \hline
    \end{array}\)

    As suggested by the table above, containing just the first ten elements of
    each set, the values not contained in $A$ are contained in $B$, and
    vice-versa. Verifying more and more values (higher $n$) provides more and more
    evidence that these four relationships hold true:

    \(\begin{array}{rcl}
    A \cup B & = & {\mathbf Z^+}\\
    A \cap B & = & \emptyset \\
    \overline{A} & = & B \\
    \overline{B} & = & A \\
    \end{array}\)

    This is the conjecture, that these two sets exhaustively \ldquo{}partition\rdquo the
    positive integers into two disjoint, mutually complementary sets.

    To prove this (not just verify it) we will need a couple more preliminary
    definitions:

    For $x$ a real number, let $\{x\}$ be the fractional part of $x$. For example
    $\{3.14159\} = 0.14159$. Then

    \(\lfloor x \rfloor = x - \{x\}\)

    Let $[booleanExpression]$ mean the value of the C++ expression using the
    ternary conditional operator as follows: $(booleanExpression\ ?\ 1\ :\ 0)$

    In other words, the expression in the square brackets is evaluated, and if its
    value is true, the whole expression, square-brackets and all, is replaced by
    the number 1. If the value is false, it's replaced by 0.

** TODO Go Deeper

     Let \(\mathtt{Num}(X, n) = \) the number of elements in the set X that are
     less than or equal to $n$. The table below shows the first few values:

     | 4 |    5 | 3                      |   13 | 1                      | 4                                           |
     | 5 |    7 | 4                      |   17 | 1                      | 5                                           |
     | 6 |    8 | 4                      |   20 | 2                      | 6                                           |

     Notice that the values in the first and last columns are the same. If that
     relationship can be shown to always hold, that fact will force the truth of
     the conjecture. Do you see how?

     So how do we prove that this relationship always holds? Following the
     implications of all our definitions (except now letting \(Num(x, n)\) be the
     number of elements of the set /generated by/ $x$ that are less than or equal
     to $n$):

    \(\begin{array}\mathtt{Num}(x, n) & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ \lfloor ix \rfloor \le n\ \right] \\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ \lfloor ix \rfloor < n + 1\ \right] \\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}[\ ix < n + 1\ ]\ \mbox{because}\ (\lfloor a \rfloor < b) \leftrightarrow (a < b)\ \mbox{--- wait, is this justified?}\\
            & = & \sum_{i > 0}\left[\ 0 < i < \frac{n + 1}{x}\ \right]\ \mbox{to make it easier and because we can divide through by}\ x\\
            & = & \left \lfloor \frac{n + 1}{x} \right \rfloor\ \mbox{because the number of integers in the open interval}\ (0, y) = \lfloor y \rfloor.
    \end{array}\)

    The last step is justified as long as $y$ is a noninteger.

    Remember, our conjecture is equivalent to saying $\mathtt{Num}(\sqrt{2}, n)+
    \mathtt{Num}(2 + \sqrt{2}, n) = n$. So plug in $\sqrt{2}$ and $2 + \sqrt{2}$
    for $x$ twice:

    $\mathtt{Num}(\sqrt{2}, n)+ \mathtt{Num}(2 + \sqrt{2}, n) = \left \lfloor
    \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}} \right \rfloor = n$

    $\rightarrow \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} - \left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} +
    \frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}} - \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right\} = n$

    $\rightarrow \frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{n + 1}{2 + \sqrt{2}} -
    \left(\left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} + \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}}\right\}\right) = n$

    $\rightarrow (n + 1)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right) -
    \left(\left\{\frac{n + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right\} + \left\{\frac{n + 1}{2 +
    \sqrt{2}}\right\}\right) = n$

    How would you finish this proof?

* Combinatorial Proofs
** TODO Validate A Committee with Chair and Co-Chair Identity
    Give a *combinatorial argument* that if n is a positive integer then

    \(\sum^n_{k = 0} k^2{n \choose k} = n(n + 1)2^{n - 2}.\)

    Hint: show that both sides count the ways to select a subset of a set of n
    elements together with two not necessarily distinct elements from this subset.
    It will be easier to do so if you express the right-hand side of the identity
    as the equivalent n(n - 1)2^{n - 2} + n2^{n - 1} (after verifying that they are
    indeed equivalent).

** TODO Validate Another Identity
    Using a *combinatorial argument*, argue for the validity of the identity

    \({n \choose r}{r \choose k} = {n \choose k}{n - k \choose r - k}\)

    whenever n, r, and k are nonnegative integers with r \le n and k \le r.

* Basic Probability Theory
** TODO Answer a Probability Question
    A dark room contains two barrels. The first barrel is filled with green
    marbles, the second is filled with a half-and-half mixture of green and blue
    marbles. So there\rsquo{}s a 100% chance of choosing a green marble from the first
    barrel, and a 50% chance of choosing either color in the second barrel. You
    reach into one of the barrels (it\rsquo{}s dark so you don\rsquo{}t know which one) and
    select a marble at random. It\rsquo{}s green. You select another. It\rsquo{}s green too. You
    select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time. What is the *minimum*
    number of marbles you need to select to *exceed* a probability of 99% that you
    are picking them out of the all-green barrel? (Note that there are enough
    marbles so that the answer does not depend on how many marbles are in the
    second barrel.)

    :HINT:
    These are all independent events, so the probability of choosing n green
    marbles in a row from the half-and-half barrel is (1/2)^n. Compute the
    complementary probability --- that of choosing at least one blue marble ---
    to be 1 - (1/2)^n. That probability first exceeds 99% when n equals what? In
    other words, after how many green marbles in a row are you 99+% sure that
    you are picking marbles out of the all-green barrel?

** TODO Answer Another Probability Question
   Take a deep breath. Suppose Shakespeare\rsquo{}s account is accurate and Julius
   Caesar gasped \ldquo{}You too, Brutus\rdquo before breathing his last. What is the
   probability that you just inhaled a molecule that Julius Caesar exhaled in
   his dying breath?

   Assume that after more than two thousand years the exhaled molecules are
   uniformly spread about the world and the vast majority are still free in the
   atmosphere. Assume further that there are 10^{44} molecules of air in the world,
   and that your inhaled quantity and Caesar\rsquo{}s exhaled quantity were each about
   2.2 x 10^{22} molecules.

   :HINT:
   If a number x is small, then (1 - x) is approximately equal to e^{-x}, where e =
   2.718281828 (approximately).

** TODO Answer Yet Another Probability Question
   If students Art, Bill, Cathy, and Diane each speak the truth once in three
   times (independently), and Art affirms that Bill denies that Cathy declares
   that Diane is a liar, what is the probability that Diane was speaking the
   truth?

   You may assume that:

  1. All four students made statements.
  2. Art, Bill, and Cathy each made a statement that either affirmed or denied
       the statement that follows.
  3. A lying affirmation is taken to be a denial and a lying denial is taken to
     be an affirmation.
