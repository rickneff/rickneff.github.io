  More mapping versus looping.

  In the context of the binary-predicate/nested-quantifier code you were
  expected to write using loops, explore the following code that is implemented
  in the functional programming way (with implicit mapping):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun map-for-all (pred x domain-y)
    (every (lambda (y) (funcall pred x y)) domain-y))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent

    (every (lambda (x) (map-for-all pred x domain-y)) domain-x))

  Here is one way to do a Cartesian product of two 3-element sets:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results raw
  (let* ((A [a b c])
         (B [1 2 3]))
    (list (list 'a 1) (list 'a 2) (list 'a 3)
          (list 'b 1) (list 'b 2) (list 'b 3)
          (list 'c 1) (list 'c 2) (list 'c 3)))
#+END_SRC

: ((a 1) (a 2) (a 3) (b 1) (b 2) (b 3) (c 1) (c 2) (c 3))

  Here is a better way, that avoids hardcoding literal elements from sets =A=
  and =B=, and renders the list-of-lists result as a table:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let* ((A [a b c])
         (B [1 2 3])
         (A0 (elt A 0))
         (A1 (elt A 1))
         (A2 (elt A 2))
         (B0 (elt B 0))
         (B1 (elt B 1))
         (B2 (elt B 2)))
    (list (list A0 B0) (list A0 B1) (list A0 B2)
          (list A1 B0) (list A1 B1) (list A1 B2)
          (list A2 B0) (list A2 B1) (list A2 B2)))
#+END_SRC

| a | 1 |
| a | 2 |
| a | 3 |
| b | 1 |
| b | 2 |
| b | 3 |
| c | 1 |
| c | 2 |
| c | 3 |

  Here is a much better way that defines a function that returns the Cartesian
  product of /three/ sets, and that also allows the sets to be of different
  sizes:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun cartesian-product-3 (s1 s2 s3)
    (loop for i across s1
          append (loop for j across s2
                       append (loop for k across s3
                                    collect (list i j k)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cartesian-product-3 [a b c d] [1 2] [x y z w t])
#+END_SRC

| a | 1 | x |
| a | 1 | y |
| a | 1 | z |
| a | 1 | w |
| a | 1 | t |
| a | 2 | x |
| a | 2 | y |
| a | 2 | z |
| a | 2 | w |
| a | 2 | t |
| b | 1 | x |
| b | 1 | y |
| b | 1 | z |
| b | 1 | w |
| b | 1 | t |
| b | 2 | x |
| b | 2 | y |
| b | 2 | z |
| b | 2 | w |
| b | 2 | t |
| c | 1 | x |
| c | 1 | y |
| c | 1 | z |
| c | 1 | w |
| c | 1 | t |
| c | 2 | x |
| c | 2 | y |
| c | 2 | z |
| c | 2 | w |
| c | 2 | t |
| d | 1 | x |
| d | 1 | y |
| d | 1 | z |
| d | 1 | w |
| d | 1 | t |
| d | 2 | x |
| d | 2 | y |
| d | 2 | z |
| d | 2 | w |
| d | 2 | t |

  We can do better still. The problem is to figure out how best to generalize
  this to a Cartesian product of /n/ sets, again allowing for arbitrary sizes.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: To generalize this to /n/ any-sized sets is a hard problem. Try to
            think of an approach that appears promising. Write it up in English
            so that your ideas can perhaps be coded up later.

  How many possible binary relations are there on a set with 3 elements?

  (defun number-of-binary-relations (n)
    "Computes the number of binary relations on a set with n elements."
    ;;...
    )
#+END_SRC
:HINT:
  - Hint :: How big is the Cartesian product of a set with 3 elements times
            itself? The number of possible binary relations is the number of
            subsets of that Cartesian product.
  - Code Hint :: What you are replacing the comment line (=;;...=) with is a
                 one-line expression (two to the fourth characters, to be exact)
                 computing the function of /n/ described in the other hint.

  Study the following code and add to it your own. The =setq= chain implements a
  very simple and simplistic database of students and courses. Double check by
  just looking at it, but also write code to

  - find all students who have taken all courses, using the predicate
    =student-has-taken-course=.
  - find all courses that have been taken by all students, using the predicate
    =course-has-been-taken-by-student=.

  You will want some kind of =for-all-for-all= function that takes a predicate
  and two domains, like what you have already seen.
