* Pursuing Knowledge and Truth 
  Continuing my quest to give you a glimpse of where I am at in this pursuit, I
  present to you a few more ideas to ponder, starting with another source from
  the same author as last time, but much shorter. Here is an argument expressed
  as commentary this logical thinker, Orson Scott Card, makes in his book
  entitled /Empire/ about the thoughts and behavior of certain fictional
  military characters:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If you always behave rationally, then reason becomes the leash by which your
  enemy pulls you. Yet if you knowingly make irrational decisions, have you not
  betrayed your own ability? The battlefield is not a place for actors, playing
  the role of this or that style of commander, for you can always imitate a
  worse commander, but never a better one. You must be yourself, even if your
  enemy comes to know your weaknesses, for you cannot pretend to have personal
  abilities and traits that you do not have.
#+END_QUOTE

  To analogize, our life is a battlefield and the enemy is Satan. Our
  protection? Weapons? Putting on the \ldquo{}full armor of God\rdquo (see Ephesians 6:11-18
  and Doctrine and Covenants 27:15-18) is not just a nice analogy, it is a vital
  necessity!

  How many \ldquo{}rational\rdquo human beings has Satan pulled by the leash of reason? Like
  he pulled those hard-hearted, unbelieving Nephites who \ldquo{}began to reason and to
  contend among themselves, saying: That it is not /reasonable/ that such a
  being as a Christ shall come\rdquo (Helaman 16:17-18; emphasis added).

  But even if Satan knows our weaknesses, his power is limited: \ldquo{}And he became
  Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind
  men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken
  unto my voice\rdquo (Moses 4:4). If we hearken unto the voice of the Lord, Satan
  has no power over us. He is bound. I love this quote from President Spencer W.
  Kimball:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  \ldquo{}When Satan is bound in a single home --- when Satan is bound in a single life
  -- the Millennium has already begun in that home, in that life.\rdquo
#+END_QUOTE

  If it is true that we cannot pretend to have personal abilities and traits
  that we do not have, is it also true that we cannot /aspire/ to have personal
  abilities and traits that we do not yet have? I think not. It\rsquo{}s the \ldquo{}as if\rdquo
  principle. If we act /as if/ we have certain desirable traits --- without
  hypocrisy --- then slowly but surely, eventually there will be no \ldquo{}as if\rdquo
  about it --- we will have those desirable traits --- Christ-like attributes
  and traits!

  To quote Lynn G. Robbins of the Seventy in the concluding session of
  April 2011 General Conference:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  To become as [Christ] /is/, we must also /do/ the things He /did/: \ldquo{}Verily,
  verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must
  /do/ in my church; for the works which ye have seen me /do/ that shall ye also
  /do/\rdquo (3 Nephi 27:21; emphasis added).
#+END_QUOTE

* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and discuss these ideas in the context of what you have achieved
  (or will have achieved) regarding this week\rsquo{}s assignment. Focus particularly
  on the truth of, or your *aspiration* to apprehend the truth of, or your
  *aspiration* to acquire the abilities to apprehend the truth of:

  1. Elementary Number Theory
  2. ENT as it touches ratios of integers and intervals in scales
  3. My Idiosyncratic Letter-to-Number Mapping
  4. The Inverse Mapping
  5. The difference between *true* and *pseudo* randomness.
  6. The TLA Pattern in my book

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students\rsquo{} answers, either adding to their 
  answers, or comparing/contrasting theirs to/with yours.
