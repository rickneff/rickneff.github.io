* TODO Answer a Question Involving Multiple Ideas
  The Pythagoreans may have been the first to notice that the most beautiful
  harmonies produced by lyres or flutes corresponded to the simplest fractional
  ratios between the lengths of vibrating strings or pipes. The *Pythagorean
  Scale* gives the numerical ratios of frequencies determining the principal
  intervals on which Western music is essentially based. Also known as the pure
  *diatonic scale*, these frequencies (in inverse proportion to the lengths of
  the vibrating elements) are in the ratios 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48, giving many
  instances of simple ratios which underlie harmonies that are pleasing to the
  ear.

  Demonstrate an understanding of what meaning the 2-digit numbers (the 8
  numbers separated by colons) have by matching the interval on the scale in the
  first column with the corresponding *simple ratio* in the second column. (You
  don\rsquo{}t need to know music theory to answer this --- logical thinking will
  suffice.)

  | Scale Interval   | Simple Ratio |
  |------------------+--------------|
  | a perfect unison |         15:8 |
  | a major second   |          2:1 |
  | a major third    |          1:1 |
  | a perfect fourth |          5:3 |
  | a perfect fifth  |          9:8 |
  | a major sixth    |          5:4 |
  | a major seventh  |          3:2 |
  | a perfect octave |          4:3 |

  Which goes with which? Reproduce the table above with the correct matching.

* TODO Characterize a Letter-to-Number Mapping
  Put Xs in the appropriate column (maybe more than one per row). The first four
  rows have been done for you:

  | Letter | Number | Visual       | Aural         | Other                 |
  |        |        | (looks like) | (sounds like) | (some logical reason) |
  |--------+--------+--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
  | A      |      8 |              | X             |                       |
  | B      |      9 |              |               | X                     |
  | C      |      0 | X            |               |                       |

  | N      |      9 |              |               |                       |

  | Z      |      0 |              |               |                       |

* TODO Code The Inverse Mapping
  Since the letters-to-number mapping was many-to-one, the inverse
  number-to-letters mapping will be one-to-many:

  | Number | Letters |
  |--------+---------|
  |      0 | ZCD     |
  |      1 | OU      |
  |      2 | TW      |
  |      3 | EM      |
  |      4 | QR      |
  |      5 | FIV     |
  |      6 | GJX     |
  |      7 | SLY     |
  |      8 | AHK     |
  |      9 | BNP     |

  Write elisp code to take a string of 3 digits and generate a random TLA with
  this mapping. For full credit, *make sure* that your elisp code generates a
  [[https://rickneff.github.io/2849207729810662635113/randomness-pseudo-and-true.org][*true random* NOT a *pseudorandom*]] TLA.

* TODO Discern a Pattern
  In his book Brother Neff uses a TLA-based naming scheme to identify major
  headings, minor headings, minor subheadings, and EPPs. 

  The pattern for major/minor headings is trivial to discern:
  - ONE
    - ABC
    - DEF
    - GHI
  - TWO
    - JKL
    - MNO
    - PQR
  - THR
    - STU
    - VWX
    - YZ@

  Minor subheadings have an easily-discernible pattern as well, e.g.:

  (ABC ABD ABE ABF ABG ABH ABI ABJ ABK ABL ABM ABN ABO)

  What about the EPPs (Exercises, Problems, Puzzles)? What is their pattern?

* TODO What Is True?

   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

#+name: assertions-about-MIs
  - [ ] There are fewer than four.
  - [ ] There are fewer than three.

  - [ ] I got the right answer for the first matching problem. 
  - [ ] I got the \ldquo{}right\rdquo answer for the \ldquo{}Characterize a Letter-to-Number Mapping\rdquo problem.
